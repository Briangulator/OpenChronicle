			<h1>The Legend of Mata Nui</h1>
			<p>In the time before time, the Great Spirit descended from the heavens, carrying we, the ones called the Matoran, to this island paradise. We were separate and without purpose, so the Great Spirit blessed us with three virtues: unity, duty, and destiny.  We embraced these gifts and, in gratitude, we named our island home Mata Nui, after the Great Spirit himself.</p>
			<p>But our happiness was not to last.  Mata Nui's brother, Makuta, was jealous of these honors and betrayed him.  Makuta cast a spell over Mata Nui, who fell into a deep slumber.  Makuta's power dominated the land, as fields withered away, sunlight grew cold, and ancient values were forgotten.</p>
			<p>Still, all hope was not lost.  Legends told of six mighty heroes, the Toa, who would arrive to save Mata Nui.  Time would reveal that these were not simply myths-for the Toa did appear on the shores of the island.  They arrived with no memory, no knowledge of one another-but they pledged to defend Mata Nui and its people against the darkness.  Tahu, Toa of Fire.  Onua, Toa of Earth.  Gali, Toa of Water.  Lewa, Toa of Air.  Pohatu, Toa of Stone.  And Kopaka, Toa of Ice.  Great warriors with great power, drawn from the very elements themselves.  Together, they were six heroes with one destiny: to defeat Makuta and save Mata Nui.</p>
			<p>This is their story.</p>

			<h1>BIONICLE Chronicles #1: Tale of the Toa</h1>
			<h3>C. A. Hapka</h3>
			<h2>1. Tahu-Toa of Fire</h2>
			<p>A beach. He was standing on a sweeping expanse of sand sloping gently down to the sea. As he gazed out at the ocean, he saw waves breaking over a coral reef. Beyond that, there was nothing but water stretching to an unbroken horizon.</p>
			<p><i>Where am I?</i> he thought, his mind a haze of memories and dreams. <i>WHO am I?</i></p>
			<p><i>...Tahu...</i></p>
			<p>The word-a name?-floated through his mind. It seemed to fit, to make sense somehow. But little else did.</p>
			<p>Tahu shook his head in frustration. Why couldn't he remember more? How had he come to this place-and why?</p>
			<p>He glanced toward the polished canister that had brought him here. Near it he saw several red components lying on the sand. Two turned out to be blades, shaped into the form of leaping red flames. They fitted together into a sword, the handle sitting comfortably in his clawed hand. But when he swung the sword, it felt heavy and awkward.</p>
			<p>He scowled. "Useless hunk of metal," he muttered, jabbing the blade into the sand. Then he noticed the mask. It stared up at him with gaping eyeholes, its surface catching the sunlight so that it appeared to come alive in his hands. Taking a deep breath, Tahu lifted the mask to his face.</p>
			<p>A surge of power coursed through him. Yes! This was more like it!</p>
			<p>Tahu grabbed the flame sword and lifted it. This time, to his surprise, the blade was glowing with crimson fire. When he swung the sword, it sizzled through the air, trailing sparks in its wake.</p>
			<p>"Yes!" Tahu said with grim satisfaction. "Now we're getting somewhere."</p>
			<p>But was he? He let the sword fall to his side, overwhelmed by despair. Why was he here? What was he supposed to do now?</p>
			<p>"Why-can't-I-REMEMBER?" He howled, swinging his sword over his head.</p>
			<p>A bolt of fiery energy shot forth, erupting into the sky like a volcano. Sparks showered down onto the beach, but Tahu didn't feel their heat.</p>
			<p><i>Power, I have such power,</i> he thought with wonder. <i>The power of fire. Of heat and flame. But where does it come from? What is it for?</i></p>
			<p>More questions-and still he had no answers. Not knowing made him shake with frustration and rage. It made him want to turn his sword against the earth, the sky, the beach-the very world itself. It was tempting-so tempting. To lose himself in chaos, to strike out with no thought for past, future, or anything else.</p>
			<p>Tahu took a deep breath. No. He couldn't allow himself to give in. Somehow he knew that, just as he'd known his name.</p>
			<p><i>Okay, okay,</i> he told himself. <i>The knowing will come. At least...I hope it will.</i></p>
			<h2>2. Lewa-Toa of Air</h2>
			<p>"This sturdy clingtwiner will do, I expect," the bright green figure murmured to himself, stretching to grab a thick fine that was hanging down in front of him. He glanced into the canyon below, then shook his head and grinned. "No secondthink, just go...!"</p>
			<p>With that, he leaped off the tree branch overhanging the canyon. He swung himself halfway across, then let go. Momentum carried him in a graceful arc over and past the gorge.</p>
			<p>He laughed with delight as he landed cleanly on a nearby tree.</p>
			<p>"Now <i>that</i> was fun," he exclaimed.</p>
			<p>He hadn't been sure that he could make such a leap. But now he knew at least one thing: The air was his friend!</p>
			<p>He didn't know much else. He knew his name was Lewa. At least he thought so. He liked the name-it sounded strong and mysterious.</p>
			<p><i>Lewa, mysteryking of know-nothingness,</i> he thought with a smile. <i>That's me!</i></p>
			<p>He glanced down at himself, at his strong limbs the color of the jungle leaves. In one hand he carried an axlike blade, perfect for slicing through thick underbrush or twining foliage. Though he couldn't see it, he knew that his bright green mask swept back in a streamlined shape perfect for cutting through the air.</p>
			<p>His smile faded as his mind flashed back to the dreams. Was that all they were? Dreams? He hoped so-for they had been dark and chaotic, and filled him with fear.</p>
			<p>"Never mind," he muttered. "Time enough for darkthought later. It's time for some answerfinding."</p>
			<p>Lewa had immediately found himself drawn to the lush, dripping jungle. Now that he was here, he felt at home.</p>
			<p>As he reached the edge of a large stand of Volo trees, Lewa jumped onto a slender branch. The motion flung something out of a nest of feathers and twigs farther along the branch.</p>
			<p>He cried out in dismay, realizing that he had just ejected a baby Taku out of its nest. Without thought, he flung one arm upward through the air in the direction of the falling chick.</p>
			<p>"Up you go!" he cried.</p>
			<p>For a moment he thought that the baby bird was flying away. Then he realized the truth.</p>
			<p>No, not flying-the wind had caught it and carried it aloft.</p>
			<p>Leaping across to a closer branch, Lewa reached up and caught the chick gently in one hand. He placed it carefully back in its nest.</p>
			<p>"Now, what kind of happyluck was that?" he murmured. "Or-or <i>was</i> it?"</p>
			<p>Struck with a sudden impulse, he flung up his arm. Once again, a quick gust swooped up from below with a swirl of leaves.</p>
			<p>"It was <i>me</i>!" Lewa breathed in amazement. "<i>I</i> did it. The wind answers to <i>me</i>!"</p>
			<h2>3. Onua-Toa of Earth</h2>
			<p><i>Dig, pull, scrape, push. Dig, pull, scrape, push.</i></p>
			<p>Onua fell into comfortable rhythm as he scooped out a new tunnel. He was happy to be underground.</p>
			<p>But he still felt uneasy. Aside from his name, he didn't know anything about who or where he was. And he couldn't shake the feeling that he was somehow missing something-missing a piece of himself.</p>
			<p>But he pushed that worry aside. There was no sense in wasting energy fretting over what he couldn't control. All he could do was control what he could-like the digging.</p>
			<p>Onua powered his huge hand forward through a rocky section of the tunnel wall. It met empty air instead of earth and rock. Interesting.</p>
			<p>Pushing through with a shower of stones and clay, Onua found himself in a large cavern. In the center, a tower of rock ended in in a flat stone platform. Atop it, a lightstone glowed.</p>
			<p><i>So there are others underground,</i> Onua thought. <i>Perhaps they will have some answers for me.</i></p>
			<p>He spotted a tunnel in the far wall of the cavern and followed it.</p>
			<p>Turning a corner, he was startled to see a familiar-looking figure at the center of a large mural.</p>
			<p>"Is that-me?" he whispered, reaching out to touch the image. It portrayed a powerful-looking figure with a wedge-shaped mask and large clawed hands. The figure was standing among five other, similar figures.</p>
			<p>As Onua touched the lines of the carving, he felt a strange vibration in the wall. Stepping forward, he put his head to it, listening intently.</p>
			<p><i>Thunka thunka thunka thunka thunka...</i></p>
			<p>It was a steady rhythm. Onua had no idea what it meant. But he planeed to find out. With one last glance at the picture of himself, he turned and continued down the tunnel, keeping one hand on the wall to follow the vibrations.</p>
			<p>The pulsing grew stronger and stronger-and with the next twist of the tunnel, Onua found what he was looking for. Another enormous cavern lay before him, lit by more lightstone platforms. Dozens of stone columns stretched up to the high ceiling. Between these columns were paths made of cobblestones set into the earthen floor. Stone benches stood beside the paths, and a small, clear stream trickled through the cavern.</p>
			<p><i>It must be a-a park of some sort,</i> Onua realized. <i>But-down here? Why-and how?</i></p>
			<p>Stepping forward, he saw that the little stream emptied out into a still, round pool lined with pebbles. In the center, reddish-brown gemstones spelled out a word:</p>
			<p><b>ONU-KORO</b></p>
			<p><i>Onu-Koro</i>-what did that mean? What kind of connection did it have with his name?</p>
			<p>Before he had time to ponder this, Onua saw a small figure hurrying across the park.</p>
			<p>Onua leaped forward. "You there!" he called. "Hey, hello!"</p>
			<p>The figure glanced over his shoulder, then stopped short. "Oh!" he exclaimed. "Oh, oh."</p>
			<p>Onua frowned. Perhaps this being didn't speak the same language as he did. He cleared his throat. "Hel-lo," he said as slowly and clearly as he could. "Me-Ouna." He put a hand to his chest, then pointed toward the other. "Who-you? Do-you-understand-me?"</p>
			<p>"Oh, yes!" the small figure cried, bending into a sort of hurried bow. "Oh, Toa Onua-we have been waiting for you such a long time! Come, please-Turaga Whenua will want to see you right away."</p>
			<p>Confused, Onua followed him. "You know my name," he said. "But I don't know yours."</p>
			<p>"Oh! Forgive my rudeness, Toa. My name is Onepu. I am a Matoran of this village of Onu-Koro."</p>
			<p>Onepu led the way through a series of tunnels and caverns. Soon they reached another large cavern. On each wall, a series of carved-out dwellings climbed nearly to the ceiling.</p>
			<p>"Wait here, please, Toa," Onepu said, gesturing toward a large stone bench near the fountain. "I will fetch the Turaga."</p>
			<p>Onua nodded, and the Matoran rushed off. Onua took the opportunity to look around. At the center of the cavern was a fountain filled with crystal-clear water. A sculpture arose from the pool, spouting water out of several spots.</p>
			<p>Onua blinked. Was he going crazy, or did that sculpture look an awful lot like-him?</p>
			<p>He was still staring at the fountain when he heard someone behind him. Turning, he saw a figure much like Onepu, but a bit taller and with a different mask. The eyes behind that mask held patience, caution, and great wisdom.</p>
			<p>"I am Whenua, Turaga of this village," the stranger said, bowing. "Welcome, Toa Onua. We have been awaiting you."</p>
			<p>"Yes, so I've heard," Onua replied. "And I've been awaiting some clue about who I am and what I'm doing here."</p>
			<p>"The legends said that would be the case," Whenua said. "It was said that the Toa, when they arrived, would remember very little."</p>
			<p>"You said when 'they' arrived," Onua said. "Are there-are there others like me?"</p>
			<p>Whenua nodded. "There are five others," he said. "Each of you draws his power from a different element-yours is the earth itself. Your purpose is to use that power to face and fight a mighty evil-Makuta."</p>
			<p>Though Onua wasn't sure why, the name sent a chill through him. An image floated into his mind-dark, empty eyes in an even darker face shrouded with gray smoke.</p>
			<p>"Makuta?" Onua repeated as the image floated away. "Who or what is this Makuta?"</p>
			<p>"He is the darkness, the essence of chaos and emptiness and fear, the spirit of destruction." Whenua replied in a trembling voice. "It is said that only the Toa have the power to stand against him."</p>
			<p>"'It is said'?" Onua asked. "You don't sound too certain about our success."</p>
			<p>Whenua shook his head sadly. "It serves no purpose to be false, for the earth cannot be deceived," he said. "Nothing about your quest is certain, except that it is your duty to try. That is all that any of us can do in this life."</p>
			<p>"I will do what I can," he promised solemnly. "But first, you must tell me all you know of these powers you say I have."</p>
			<p>"Of course, Toa," Whenua said. "For that is <i>my</i> duty. First, you should know that the power itself comes from within you, but it is focused through your mask-the Pakari, the Great Mask of Strength."</p>
			<p>"My-my mask?" Onua touched his hand to his face, remembering the surge of strength and power when he'd first put it on.</p>
			<p>Whenua nodded somberly. "The Pakari gives you power-great power," he said. "But one mask will not be enough..."</p>
			<h2>4. Gali-Toa of Water</h2>
			<p>The waters lifted her, carrying her along in a soft current of warmth. She didn't know who or where she was, but she knew she belonged here in the calm, cool blue of the sea. That was perhaps the only thing she knew for sure.</p>
			<p>That and her name: Gali.</p>
			<p><i>But I can't just float here forever, </i> she reminded herself. <i>I have things to do. If only I knew what they were...</i></p>
			<p>She had no certain memories, but many uncertain ones-fragments of thoughts and images. There was urgency in those fragments, though some of them hinted at peace as well. Especially one, an endless sea of calm water surrounding an island, embracing it and soothing its ills...</p>
			<p>Gali kicked swiftly forward with her flipperlike feet. Her hooked arms cut through the water, and the ridged edges on her blue mask sent bubbly ripples out to the sides as she swam. The sea was full of life, but Gali felt strangely alone.</p>
			<p>As she swam, she felt a shivering tremor radiate through the water. A brightly colored eel raced past her. Several schools of fish followed.</p>
			<p>Gali paused and stared in the direction the creatures had come. What had frightened them?</p>
			<p>More fish rushed past her in a panic, along with several crabs and snails and even a small shark. Gali pushed forward, swimming against the tide of fleeing sea creatures.</p>
			<p>A large coral reef blocked her view of whatever lay beyond. As she swam around it, Gali saw a gigantic creature barreling toward her. The water churned around its vicious-looking snout as its long, powerful arms pulled it forward toward Gali faster and faster.</p>
			<p>Gali gasped. She had no idea what the monster might be, but she could see why the other creatures had fled. The predator wore a dingy-looking, ugly mask over its triangular face, and its gleaming red eyes were ruthless and savage.</p>
			<p>There was no time to outswim the huge creature-it was already too close. For a fraction of a second Gali thought of using the coral reef for protection. But she couldn't stand to imagine the creature crashing through the delicate structures, destroying the living coral.</p>
			<p>Gali let her instincts take over. Pushing off of the coral, she bulleted through the water off to one side. Then she shot toward the surface. She broke the surface and extended her arms, not sure why she was doing so.</p>
			<p>She felt the waters gather and respond to her call. As the giant sea creature burst to the surface a short distance away, an enormous wave formed around her. Her vicious pursuer leaped forward, but the tidal wave rocketed Gali away toward the shore, faster than any creature could swim. Gali smiled as the water carried her to safety. <i>So this is what I am meant to do,</i> she thought. <i>I am here to command the seas. But for what purpose?</i></p>
			<p>A few minutes later, Gali shook herself dry as she stepped out of the surf onto the beach. She stood there for a moment, looking around, strangely reluctant to leave the water.</p>
			<p>She glanced across the beach. A thick, dripping jungle began where the sands left off. The humidity of the place reached out, beckoning to her, and she could not resist its call.</p>
			<h2>5. Pohatu-Toa of Stone</h2>
			<p>Pohatu glanced over his shoulder. On the wall that surrounded the village of Po-Koro, dozens of Matoran were gathered, watching him go. Grinning, Pohatu shaded his eyes with one hand and gave them a quick wave with the other. The villagers waved back and cheered.</p>
			<p>That was an interesting visit," Pohatu said aloud to himself as he turned away again. "It's not every day you find out you're the Toa of Stone."</p>
			<p>He almost tripped on a protruding stone in the path. Glancing down, he saw three words spelled out in cobblestones beneath his feet-</p>
			<p><b>UNITY</b></p>
			<p><b>DUTY</b></p>
			<p><b>DESTINY</b></p>
			<p>"Hmm, now where have I heard those words before?" Pohatu murmured with a chuckle. The Turaga of Po-Koro had told him of many things-the strange, dark history of this island of Mata Nui, the mysterious masks that were hidden throughout the island, and best of all that there were five other Toa with powers as strong as his own.</p>
			<p>As the village elder spoke, three words had come up again and again-unity, duty, destiny. These three concepts had given the Matoran a purpose, something to strive for always.</p>
			<p>Now it was time to see the rest of this island.</p>
			<p><i>Turaga Onewa said this mask I wear is the Kanohi Kakama, the Great Mask of Speed,</i> Pohatu thought. <i>Maybe it's time to put it to the test.</i></p>
			<p>He hesitated, wondering if it was wise to experiment with his powers when he still knew so little about how they worked.</p>
			<p>But what was the worst that could happen? Gathering his energy, Pohatu directed his gaze toward the top of Mount Ihu-and ran.</p>
			<p>The desert landscape passed in a yellowish blur, all details obscured by the Toa's immense speed. After a moment the yellowish blur shifted into a brown one punctuated by flashes of green, and then quickly grew paler again until all Pohatu could see around him was white.</p>
			<p>He slowed to a stop. He was standing in a snowdrift overlooking a frozen lake. The steep, icy slopes of Mount Ihu rose above him.</p>
			<p>"Outrageous," he said breathlessly, a smile spreading behind his mask. "Now <i>that's</i> what I call speed!"</p>
			<p>Leaving the frozen lake behind, he started up the mountainside. The Turaga had told him the main temple, the Kini-Nui, was in the exact center of the island on the far side of Mount Ihu. It seemed as likely a place as any to look for the other Toa.</p>
			<p>As he turned around to check his progress, he caught a glimpse of movement somewhere farther up the slopes. A bird?</p>
			<p>"Not unless this island grows its birds awfully big," he muttered, staring at the silver-and-white figure gliding gracefully down a high mountain slope, powdery snow flying up in an arc behind his feet. No, there was only one thing it could be. Another Toa!</p>
			<p>His heart pounding, Pohatu leaped up the slopes, gathering speed-careful not to go <i>too</i> fast. He didn't want to overshoot his target.</p>
			<p>He lost sight of his quarry for a few minutes as he tromped through a narrow valley. Grumbling at the snowdrifts, which came up to his waist in some spots, he glanced upward. At the top of the valley, a rocky bluff hid the higher slopes from his view. He clambered up toward it, finally leaving the deeper snowdrifts behind. Brushing the snow from his body, Pohatu gazed at the precipice standing in his way. If he had judged the distance right, the other Toa should be on the snowy slope just on the other side.</p>
			<p>"Time for a shortcut," Pohatu murmured. "I don't want him to start skiing down that hill and get away from me. Besides, I might as well start getting used to this power of mine..."</p>
			<p>Taking a deep breath, he hunched his shoulders and raced straight at the solid stone.</p>
			<h2>6. Kopaka-Toa of Ice</h2>
			<p><i>Rumble...rumble...CRAAAAAAASSSH!</i></p>
			<p>Kopaka's ice blade was up and ready as the rocky bluff exploded. But there was no time to dodge as enormous boulders rained down around him.</p>
			<p>"Watch out!" a voice cried from somewhere in the storm of stone.</p>
			<p>Kopaka lifted his shield, protecting himself as best he could. When the eruption of stone stopped, he found himself trapped between several huge boulders.</p>
			<p>Glancing up, he saw a figure about his own size gazing down at him, resting his weight on one of the large stones. The stranger wore a bronze-colored mask, and the eyes behind it were concerned and a bit sheepish.</p>
			<p>"Sorry about that," the stranger said. "I was practicing. Are you all right?"</p>
			<p>"I would be," Kopaka returned icily. "If you weren't standing on me."</p>
			<p>The stranger jumped back a few steps, then stretched out his arm. "Let me help you out."</p>
			<p>Kopaka was already pointing his ice blade at the nearest rock. He was annoyed that the stranger's sudden appearance had taken him by surprise, caught him with his defenses down. He would not make that mistake again.</p>
			<p>"Thank you. I don't need help," he said.</p>
			<p>Focusing his energy, he channeled it through the blade. A thrill ran through him as the rock around him froze solid, becoming brittle and glassy.</p>
			<p>The other figure was still watching him anxiously. "Let me do it," he urged as Kopaka lifted his blade again. "It'll be faster."</p>
			<p>Kopaka frowned, already tired of the stranger's pushy chatter. "I said, I can do it myself!" Bringing the blade down, he smashed the icy boulder into smithereens, freeing himself.</p>
			<p>The stranger looked impressed for a moment. Then he shrugged. "Yeah, well, you missed one," he said, kicking at one remaining boulder.</p>
			<p>Kopaka blinked as the huge stone went sailing off toward the horizon. Whoever this stranger was, he was strong-incredibly strong. Kopaka supposed that meant he had to be one of the other Toa that Turaga Nuju had mentioned.</p>
			<p>But Kopaka had no interest in meeting other Toa.</p>
			<p>Turning away from the stranger, he continued on his way. The Matoran had told him there was a mask at the top of this mountain-the Place of Far-seeing, they had called it. He meant to find that mask as soon as possible.</p>
			<p>But the stranger didn't get the message. "Hey," he called. "Wait! Are you a Toa? I've been looking for you-I am Pohatu, Toa of Stone."</p>
			<p>Kopaka considered not answering-maybe if he ignored this annoying Pohatu, he would go away. But it seemed unlikely.</p>
			<p>"Kopaka," he said brusquely. "Ice. And if you don't mind, I'm in the middle of something. See you later." He bent and effortlessly rode a slight dip in the ground, his feet sliding smoothly over the ice. He soon left Pohatu behind.</p>
			<p>But it turned out that the newcomer was not to be abandoned so easily. "Wait!" he called again, scrabbling up the hill. "Listen, I have a feeling we're both here for the same reason. Why not team up? It might make things easier."</p>
			<p>"I work alone."</p>
			<p>"By choice?" Pohatu returned quickly. "Or just because no one can stand you?"</p>
			<p>Kopaka almost smiled at that. Almost. This other Toa was irritating and far too chatty, but he also seemed to be quick-witted. And he was certainly strong. Perhaps he could come in handy after all. Especially if they came across another of those huge, vicious creatures that the Matoran called Rahi...</p>
			<p>"All right," Kopaka said after a long moment. "Come along. After all, I might need a mountain moved-or the island lifted."</p>
			<p>Pohatu chuckled. "Okay," he said. "So-where are we going anyway? Should we start looking for masks, or seek the other Toa first?"</p>
			<p>Kopaka pointed toward the peak rising just above them. Then he climbed on, not bothering to check whether Pohatu was following.</p>
			<p>A few minutes later the two of them were standing at the peak of the mountain. Kopaka immediately spotted a mask lying in the snow.</p>
			<p>Pohatu saw it, too. "Good work, brother," he said. "Go ahead-claim your prize."</p>
			<p>Kopaka nodded. The new Kanohi looked gray and lifeless lying in the snow. Though it was the same size as his own mask, its shape was different-a helmetlike form with angled eyes and three slashes in each cheek.</p>
			<p><i>The Kanohi Hau,</i> Kopaka thought, remembering what the Turaga had told him. <i>The Great Mask of Shielding.</i></p>
			<p>Kopaka bent to pick up the mask. He stared at it for a moment, then carefully placed it over his own mask. Immediately, a strange feeling overwhelmed him. As if a cushion of strength had settled in all around him, protecting him from all harm.</p>
			<p>But what of his other power? Did this new mask affect them? Kopaka called forth the power of his original mask, which gave him the ability to see through stone and snow to what lay beneath. Glancing down at the ground, he saw the icy snow...and then the raw, cold dirt underneath...and below that, a layer of rock crosscut with veins of minerals.</p>
			<p>"The powers of the Mask of Vision are still mine to use." He was pleased.</p>
			<p>As he turned his gaze toward the south, his X-ray vision cut straight through the craggy bluffs to several bright spots of color far below in the foothills. Then he sighed. For a moment he was tempted to turn away, to ignore what he'd seen. But he realized he might as well face up to the inevitable.</p>
			<p>"We have to go," he told Pohatu abruptly, hating the thought of what was to come but knowing there was no avoiding it. "Now."</p>
			<p>"Why?"</p>
			<p>"No questions." Kopaka was tired of all the conversation. "Just follow me."</p>
			<p>The two of them headed down the mountain, Pohatu skidding and slipping on the icy slopes. Kopaka forced himself to move slowly so the other Toa could keep up.</p>
			<p>They were about halfway down when there was an earth-shattering roar from somewhere just ahead of them.</p>
			<p>"Uh-oh," Pohatu said. "I don't like the sound of <i>that.</i>"</p>
			<p>Before Kopaka could respond, a massive creature burst through a snowbank a short distance below where the Toa were standing, sending a shower of snow and ice shards out on all sides. Kopaka shielded his eyes, squinting at the enormous, snorting, puffing beast as it skidded to a stop just a few lengths away.</p>
			<p>"Is <i>this</i> what you were leading us toward?" Pohatu shouted, sounding dismayed.</p>
			<p>"No," Kopaka said grimly.</p>
			<p>The creature was like something out of a nightmare. Its red eyes gleamed with hate, and it pawed at the snowy ground with hooflike feet, puffs of steam blowing from its nostrils. Twin horns twisted out of the sides of its enormous head.</p>
			<p>"Hmm," Pohatu said. "Do you think this big fellow is an ally or enemy?"</p>
			<p>Kopaka glanced at him, startled, then realized the other Toa was kidding. He rolled his eyes, not amused. "Come on," he said. "I think we'd better-"</p>
			<p>At that moment the hideous creature let out another thunderous bellow-and then charged straight at them.</p>
			<p>"-run!" Pohatu finished for him.</p>
			<p>The two Toa turned and sprinted back up the slope. At least Kopaka sprinted. Pohatu tried to run, but lost his footing on the ice and went down, struggling to keep himself from sliding right back under the beast's charging hooves.</p>
			<p>Kopaka skidded to a stop, realizing the other Toa was in trouble. Big, charging, snorting trouble. Letting out a sigh, he skied back down the hill.</p>
			<p>"No! Kopaka, don't-it's too dangerous."</p>
			<p>"Don't be ridiculous." Kopaka waved his arms and shouted, trying to distract the enemy.</p>
			<p>The creature slowed, glancing from one Toa to the other, confused. Then it snorted and bellowed and returned its full attention to the fallen Pohatu, who was just now climbing unsteadily to his feet.</p>
			<p><i>Time for Plan B,</i> Kopaka thought, looking around for new ideas. They were standing on an open field that offered little in the way of hiding places. To one side, the ground dropped away sharply into a deep, icy ravine. Kopaka paused, his mind clicking into gear. If only he could get the beast to change directions...</p>
			<p>There was just one problem-the creature was almost on top of Pohatu. Two more leaps, and its horns would be buried in the other Toa's chest. There would be no time to explain.</p>
			<p><i>He'll just have to go with it,</i> Kopaka told himself grimly, already pushing off smoothly and gathering speed as he skied downhill toward the fallen Toa. <i>If he doesn't, well...</i></p>
			<p>There was no sense worrying.</p>
			<p>"Here goes nothing," he muttered.</p>
			<p><i>SNORT!</i> The beast made another leap forward. It lowered its head, aiming its horns directly at Pohatu. Pohatu took a step backward, almost falling again as his foot hit an icy patch.</p>
			<p>Meanwhile, Kopaka skied toward him, gathering speed. This would be close...</p>
			<p>"Heads up!" he shouted. "And arms OUT!"</p>
			<p>Pohatu looked startled, but flung his arms out to his sides.</p>
			<p>Just as the creature lunged forward, snorting eagerly, Kopaka whizzed past and grabbed Pohatu around the chest.</p>
			<p>"OOOOF!" Pohatu grunted as Kopaka yanked him out of the beast's path just as it lunged forward and buried its horns in the snow.</p>
			<p>Kopaka wobbled, nearly losing his balance.</p>
			<p><i>I have to straighten out,</i> he thought. <i>Otherwise we'll never make it.</i> Behind him, he could already hear the beast roaring with anger and charging after them.</p>
			<p>"Where-are-we-going?" Pohatu panted. To Kopaka's relief, the Stone Toa was hanging loosely in his arms, not struggling against his grip or trying to free himself.</p>
			<p>Kopaka couldn't have replied even if he'd wanted to. He was too busy willing his feet to obey him, in a desperate attempt to control the angle of their speedy downhill slide.</p>
			<p>It worked. Just three or four lengths from the ravine now, his feet finally settled smoothly into an upright position on the icy snow. He bent as low as he could without dragging Pohatu's legs in the snow. Now there was no turning back...</p>
			<p>"Hey!" Pohatu cried, suddenly looking forward and seeing the chasm directly in front of them. "What are you-AAAAAAAAAAAAH!"</p>
			<p>Kopaka held his breath as he felt his feet leave the cold, solid surface of the ice. He held on tightly to Pohatu as they flew up-up-up and over the canyon.</p>
			<p>Pohatu was still screaming, but Kopaka didn't let out his breath until he felt his feet slam down again on the far side of the gorge. He teetered and threw himself to the side, allowing himself and Pohatu to pitch face-first into the snow.</p>
			<p>"What the-why did you do that?" Pohatu cried, spitting out a mouthful of snow. "You could have gotten us killed!"</p>
			<p>"That's why." Kopaka had already turned to stare back at the ravine. He pointed, and Pohatu turned to look just in time to see the snorting, squealing creature skid down the ice and tumble head over hooves into the depths of the fissure. A furious bellow drifted up toward them.</p>
			<p>"Oh." Pohatu was silent for a moment. Then he grinned weakly. "Er, thanks. Guess I owe you one-brother."</p>
			<p>Kopaka nodded. Then he crawled forward to the edge of the ravine, glancing down. The beast was still bellowing and struggling at the bottom, digging its hooves into the ice as it started to climb.</p>
			<p>"It will be able to climb out of there soon enough," Kopaka observed, watching as the beast leaped up to an icy ledge.</p>
			<p>"Not if I have anything to say about it," Pohatu replied. He climbed to his feet and strode toward the rocky cliff nearby. "You might want to step aside," he called over his shoulder as he began climbing hand over hand up the sheer rock face.</p>
			<p>Kopaka moved a little farther down the slope, keeping an eye on the edge of the gulch. That beast could come charging out of there at any moment...</p>
			<p>"YEEEEE-HAW!" Pohatu cried, drawing his foot back and then kicking at a huge chunk of the rock face. The solid stone cracked instantly, and an enormous boulder flew forward, toward the fissure, disappearing over its edge.</p>
			<p>Pohatu moved on to another section of the bluff. Once again he aimed a mighty kick, sending a chunk of stone across the snowy ground and straight into the gorge. Kopaka watched with grudging admiration as Pohatu repeated the movement again and again.</p>
			<p>"Okay, this is too slow," Pohatu exclaimed. "Let's try something else."</p>
			<p>What was he up to now? Kopaka had no idea. A second later Pohatu brought both fists down on the rock-and the cliff exploded into a thousand shards of stone.</p>
			<p>Remembering his first meeting with Pohatu, Kopaka covered his head with his shield. A few pebbles bounced off of it, but the bulk of the explosion of stone showered down into the ravine with a deafening roar.</p>
			<p>"Whoa!" Pohatu shouted gleefully after the noise had subsided. "That was so cool! I mean, I was pretty sure it would work, but still..."</p>
			<p>While he waited for the other Toa to rejoin him, Kopaka stepped forward and peered again over the edge of the chasm. The creature was buried up to its horns in the rocky mess that now filled nearly half of the deep canyon.</p>
			<p>Hearing Pohatu hurrying up beside him, Kopaka turned. "Nice work," he said. "It will be able to escape-but not for a long while."</p>
			<p>Pohatu glanced once more at the huge beast trapped below them. "That was close, though. What <i>is</i> that thing, anyway?"</p>
			<p>"Rahi," Kopaka told him, already turning to lead the way down the snowy slope. "That's what the Turaga said they're called. There are many species, all shapes and sizes. They're not very friendly."</p>
			<p>"No kidding."</p>
			<p>Both Toa were silent for a few minutes as they climbed and skidded down the mountain, each buried in his own thoughts. Finally, Pohatu spoke again.</p>
			<p>"So, what did you see up there, anyway?" he asked. "From the peak, I mean."</p>
			<p>This time, Kopaka decided to answer. "Strangers," he replied. "Beings of great power."</p>
			<p>They came to the top of a steep hill. Standing in an open area below, four bright spots stood out against the drab background of stone and dirt. Four figures-one a bright, burning red, another blue as the sea, a third black as starless midnight, and the final one the same bright green as the leaves on the trees.</p>
			<p>Kopaka stared down at them. The other Toa. It had to be them.</p>
			<p>"But are they allies," he murmured, "or enemies?"</p>
			<h2>7. The Meeting</h2>
			<p>Gali was the first to notice the two newcomers. "Brothers," she said quietly. "Look."</p>
			<p>One of the newcomers wore a bronze mask. He leaped easily down to land among them. "Mind if we join the party?"</p>
			<p>Tahu stepped forward. "I am Tahu, Toa of Fire. Who are you?"</p>
			<p>The bronze stranger seemed unintimidated by Tahu's fiery glare. "I'm Pohatu," he said. "Toa of Stone. My talkative friend there is the Ice Toa, Kopaka." He gestured to the silver-and-white figure standing silently behind him.</p>
			<p>The second newcomer stepped forward. Kopaka. Gali looked him up and down, feeling a chill ripple through the air as he came closer.</p>
			<p><i>This one-this one has many layers,</i> she thought uncertainly. <i>He is cold. But I sense his frosty exterior may hide a blazing fire deep within...</i></p>
			<p>At that moment, Kopaka turned his icy gaze upon her, catching her stare. He said nothing, but Gali quickly turned away.</p>
			<p>More introductions were made, and soon they were trading stories of how and where they each had awakened.</p>
			<p>As the others chatted, Kopaka said little. He was thinking about the future. What else lay in store for them here? And what of the mysterious Makuta, the evil one his villagers had spoken of?</p>
			<p>He glanced at the red one, Tahu, who was blustering on about his journey to find his village, Ta-Koro, at the top of a volcano. <i>This Fire Toa is full of hot air,</i> Kopaka thought. <i>Will he be prepared for the heat of battle, or will he burn out quickly?</i></p>
			<p>Then there was Onua, the Toa of Earth. He spoke less than the others, while listening to all that was said. Did that subdued exterior hide a busy mind, or an empty one?</p>
			<p>Just then Lewa, the Toa of Air, punctuated a comment he'd made by backflipping up onto a nearby boulder and doing a handstand. <i>So much energy,</i> Kopaka thought. <i>But it blows out of him uncontrolled, in all directions, like the wind. Not exactly someone I'd want to trust my life to in a tough spot.</i></p>
			<p>Hearing Pohatu's cheerful laugh, Kopaka turned to gaze at him. The Toa of Stone had surprised him in their battle against the horned Rahi. He had fought bravely. He had also been willing to entrust his life to Kopaka in that wild ski jump over the ravine.</p>
			<p><i>I don't know if I could have done the same,</i> Kopaka admitted to himself. Then he shook his head. <i>But why</i> should <i>he trust someone he doesn't know? It turned out well in that case, but he was foolish to be so ready to turn his life over to a stranger. I would not make that same mistake.</i></p>
			<p>Finally Kopaka turned his gaze toward Gali. Now this was one he couldn't read. The way he had caught her looking at him a few moments ago-it was as if she could see into his mind, his heart, just the way he could see through the earth and stone with his Mask of Vision. But that was impossible. Wasn't it?</p>
			<p>Gali spoke, interrupting Kopaka's thoughts. "Well, brothers," she said, turning her gaze to take in all of them. "I suppose that's enough talk of the past. We should start discussing what comes next, yes? For despite all the interesting elemental powers we may have, I expect that our best weapon is our minds."</p>
			<p>Kopaka almost smiled. At last, someone was talking sense!</p>
			<p>"You're right, Gali," Tahu said. "We need to find these masks we seek-as quickly as possible. The Turaga of my village told me they will give us great powers. I know my own mask gives me the powers of protection or shielding..."</p>
			<p>"That's right," Pohatu interrupted. "Brother Kopaka has found a Mask of Shielding, too."</p>
			<p>Tahu frowned. "Yes," he said shortly, sounding irritated. "Well, there are five more masks out there for each of us."</p>
			<p>Once again, Kopaka held back a smile. Obviously Tahu was annoyed that someone else had beaten him to the first mask.</p>
			<p>Onua looked thoughtful. "According to my Turaga, the masks are hidden all over the island and Makuta has sent his Rahi creatures to guard them. So our quest won't be easy."</p>
			<p>"Fine, fine." Tahu sounded impatient. "Anyway, the important thing is to find them-fast. We'll split into smaller groups. Gali and Lewa, you can search the jungle and beaches together. Onua and Kopaka can check the caves of Onu-Wahi. And Pohatu, you can come with-"</p>
			<p>"Hold on a quicksecond, brother Tahu," Lewa interrupted. "If speed is what we're after, why bother with the pairmaking? Why not each of us journeysearch on our own?"</p>
			<p>Onua shrugged. "Our fiery brother has a good plan," he said calmly. "Working in pairs makes sense. It strikes a balance between speed and caution."</p>
			<p>Gali was shaking her head. "Brothers, we have been brought together for a reason. I think we ought to stick together, at least until we know exactly what we're up against."</p>
			<p>Pohatu nodded. "She's right," he said. "Trust me, these Rahi creatures are nothing to face alone. But if we travel together they should give us little trouble. Right, Kopaka?"</p>
			<p>Kopaka shrugged, doing his best to chill the impatience he felt in listening to this conversation. Why hadn't he already departed? "I can't agree, Toa of Stone," he said. "We should split up. As I already told you, I prefer to work alone."</p>
			<p>Pohatu looked slightly hurt. "You may prefer it," he replied. "But would you also prefer being chased by that sharp-horned beast if I hadn't been there to help you trap it?"</p>
			<p>"Enough of this bickering," Tahu broke in impatiently. "We will accomplish nothing by standing here and having a debate. The decision is made-we split into small groups. It's the best of both worlds, can't you see that?"</p>
			<p><i>All I see is one who believes that power belongs to whoever shouts the loudest,</i> Kopaka thought in disgust. <i>Well, I, for one, am not ready to bow to such a 'leader'. Not as long as I have life in my body.</i></p>
			<p>Tahu noticed Kopaka's stare. What thoughts lay behind his mask? The Ice Toa's silence and intense gaze made Tahu uneasy, though he didn't like to admit it even to himself.</p>
			<p><i>It doesn't matter,</i> Tahu told himself, pushing such feelings aside. <i>There are other important things to worry about.</i></p>
			<p>The others were already back to arguing, several of them speaking at once.</p>
			<p><i>CRRRRRRAAAAAAAAAK!</i></p>
			<p>Suddenly, with no warning, the very earth yawned open in front of them, splitting the clearing in half. All around, the earth shuddered and trembled, smaller cracks opening here and there as the trees shook and birds took off into the air in a panic of cries.</p>
			<p>Jagged streaks of white-hot lightning streaked across the sky, striking down only a fewlengths from where the Toa stood.</p>
			<p>"Get back!" Onua shouted as the air crackled with electricity and several trees and shrubs burst into flame.</p>
			<p>Tahu leaped away with the others, though the fire held no terror for him. What was happening? A huge bank of dark clouds rolled in above them, releasing a torrent of rain and hail. A violent gust of wind howled down from farther up the mountain.</p>
			<p>"What kind of crazystorm is this?" Lewa yelled over the noise of the pounding rain and shrieking wind. "An earthquake, thunder and lightning, rain and hail and wind all at once?"</p>
			<p>Gali shook her head, shielding her face against the driving wind. "This can be no regular storm," she cried. "It must be the work of Makuta."</p>
			<p>As the word left her mouth, the storm suddenly stopped. The earth lay still. The only hint of the storm was the smoldering remains of the lightning-scorched foliage-and the huge, gaping fissure in the ground.</p>
			<p>"Eerie," Pohatu remarked.</p>
			<p>Tahu nodded grimly. "Clearly, Makuta knows we're here. There is no time to lose. We need to find those masks-now."</p>
			<h2>8. What Lies Beneath</h2>
			<p>Tahu hadn't had a destination in mind when he had stomped off from the group of Toa. He was too angry to think straight.</p>
			<p>No matter how often he had repeated his plan to split into pairs, the other Toa had refused to agree with it. Kopaka and Lewa had insisted on taking off on their own. Even Gali had seemed too distracted to argue the point-she was the only one among them who hadn't visited her village, and she was eager to find it now. And so the Toa had all gone their separate ways.</p>
			<p>Tahu's anger drove him aimlessly over the foothills around the base of Mount Ihu, then onto the fiery slopes of the volcano.</p>
			<p><i>Kopaka found one of his masks up there in the snow of his own homeland,</i> Tahu thought as he headed up the fiery mountain. <i>Why shouldn't I start my search here in my own home region?</i></p>
			<p>Thinking about Kopaka made him clench his fist tighter on the handle of his fire sword.</p>
			<p><i>It's like he just sits back and listens to us talk, thinking he's better than us,</i> Tahu thought with a snort. <i>Like it's not worth his time to get involved.</i></p>
			<p>"It's not worth <i>my</i> time to worry about the likes of him," he said aloud. "Especially now..." He swung his sword to punctuate the point, accidentally sending a finger of flame shooting out and melting a nearby pile of stones into lava.</p>
			<p>"With all due respect, great Toa, you might want to watch where you point that thing," a voice said from nearby.</p>
			<p>Tahu whirled around. Standing before him was the broad-shouldered, sturdy-looking figure of a Ta-Matoran.</p>
			<p>"I know you," the Toa said. "It's Jaller, right?"</p>
			<p>The Matoran nodded and bowed. "I am the Captain of the Guard of your village of Ta-Koro."</p>
			<p>"Hello again," Tahu said. "And while we're giving out advice, you might not want to sneak up on a Toa. It could be hazardous to your health."</p>
			<p>"Sorry, Toa," Jaller said with a grin. "I didn't mean to startle you."</p>
			<p>"Apology accepted. But what was your intention in tracking me here?"</p>
			<p>Jaller's expression turned serious. "I came to see how your search for the masks was going. Don't take this the wrong way, but...do you have any kind of plan for finding them?"</p>
			<p>Tahu frowned, feeling his fiery temper rising. How dare this lowly Matoran question his tactics?</p>
			<p>"Of course I have a plan," he snapped. "I'm searching...I'm searching for the masks...Okay. Perhaps I don't have an exact plan as such. But I'm working on it."</p>
			<p>Jaller bowed again. "Of course, Toa," he said. "In any case, I thought it might be helpful for you to know that legend has it that a Kanohi Akaku-a Great Mask of X-Ray Vision-lies within the deepest cavern of Onu-Wahi."</p>
			<p>"Onu-Wahi," Tahu repeated. "Those caves and tunnels that Onua spoke of?"</p>
			<p>"Yes," Jaller replied. "The network of underground passageways lies beneath much of Mata Nui. There is an entrance just over that way, beyond that lavastone wall. It leads to-"</p>
			<p>"Thanks," Tahu interrupted, turning away.</p>
			<p>"Toa Tahu!" Jaller called after him. "Wait!"</p>
			<p>Tahu paused, glancing over his shoulder. "Yes? What is it?" he demanded impatiently.</p>
			<p>Jaller touched one fist to his mask in a salute. "I just wanted to wish you luck," he said. "Take care in the dark underground. We just got you-we don't want to lose you again."</p>
			<p>Tahu smiled. "Worry not," he said. "You'll not get rid of me so easily."</p>
			<p>It wasn't long before Tahu realized why the Matoran had been so worried. Everything about the dark, twisting tunnels of Onu-Wahi felt wrong. Even with the glow cast by his fire sword, the darkness seemed to huddle around him, suffocating in its closeness.</p>
			<p>Taking a deep breath, he forced himself to move on. Some dark part of his mind protested-<i>No! We don't belong here, we shouldn't be here, we'll be crushed...</i></p>
			<p>But Tahu shook his head fiercely, willing such thoughts away.</p>
			<p>The air grew cold and still. The flame on his sword sputtered and flickered, but the force of his will kept it burning.</p>
			<p><i>Almost there,</i> he told himself grimly. <i>I can feel it. These tunnels can't possibly go much deeper.</i></p>
			<p>And yet they did. Deeper, and deeper, and deeper, until Tahu started to wonder if he hadn't just imagined that there was a surface world at all. Deeper-until he started seeing strange shapes moving in the shadows just beyond his glowing red light. And still deeper.</p>
			<p>Finally he stepped out of the end of a tunnel into an enormous cavern. A raw, howling wind whipped through it. Only steps ahead, the floor dropped away into nothingness. Tahu couldn't see the bottom.</p>
			<p><i>Great. Just great,</i> he thought bitterly. <i>What am I supposed to do now?</i></p>
			<p>He wasn't sure what made him look up then, but as he did, he caught the glint of something across the chasm. Squinting against the darkness beyond his sword glow, he made out the vague shape of a ledge on the opposite wall of the cavern. On that ledge was a small gray shape-a mask? He wasn't sure.</p>
			<p>In any case, the yawning depths of the chasm lay between him and the object. How was he supposed to get over there?</p>
			<p>Tahu took a few careful steps along the near wall of the cavern. As he neared the edge, he finally spotted the answer to his problem-a bridge. A narrow stone span, stretching out from the wall and disappearing into the darkness.</p>
			<p>The damp wind chilled him as he stood for a moment, uncertain. Then he shook his head. He hadn't come this far to turn back now.</p>
			<p>He stepped out onto the bridge. It was even narrower than it had looked, and it took all of Tahu's concentration to maintain his balance.</p>
			<p>After a few minutes he seemed no closer to the far ledge than when he'd started. <i>This is ridiculous,</i> he thought impatiently. <i>It's going to take forever to get across at this rate.</i></p>
			<p>He swung his foot out, taking a larger step this time. When it touched the rock, it skidded slightly to one side just as another violent wind gust swept past-and Tahu suddenly felt himself slipping sideways into the chasm!</p>
			<p>He grabbed at the bridge, wrapping his left arm around it and holding tight. His legs swung loose over the abyss. He threw his right hand up and over the bridge as well, nearly losing his grip on his sword as he did so. With a grunt, he flung his legs up, clinging upside down to the underside of the bridge.</p>
			<p>He focused on pulling himself up and to one side, inching his way around to the top of the bridge. Finally he heaved a breath of relief as he pulled himself right side up once again. After resting for a moment, he pushed himself into a crouch, and then back into a standing position.</p>
			<p><i>Okay, slow and steady it is, then,</i> Tahu told himself. <i>One foot in front of the other.</i></p>
			<p>He took a step, wavering slightly and resisting the urge to look down.</p>
			<p><i>One step, two steps-almost there...</i></p>
			<p><i>BZZZZZZZZZZZZZZ!</i></p>
			<p>Suddenly the air was filled with a loud, violent hiss that seemed to come from everywhere at once. Startled, Tahu slipped, one foot sliding out over the nothingness. Just in time, he flung himself sideways, arms outstretched, regaining his shaky balance on the narrow beam.</p>
			<p>Dozens of bright red creatures had appeared out of nowhere, swarming across the narrow bridge from both directions. Each was the size of a clenched fist and looked like a cross between a scorpion and a giant wingless firefly. Their deadly-looking pincers clamped open and shut rhythmically as they buzzed toward Tahu, their legs moving too fast to see.</p>
			<p>"Hey!" Tahu cried in annoyance, kicking at several of the creatures that were already swarming up over his feet. "Get away!"</p>
			<p>The glowing scorpions paid no attention. More and more of them swarmed around him, until they completely covered his legs.</p>
			<p>"Ow!" he cried as one of them sank its pincers into his ankle. He smacked at it, but already two more of the creatures were clamping onto his knee and thigh.</p>
			<p>"Enough of you," he muttered, pointing the sword just above the thickest cluster of the creatures on the bridge nearby. Focusing his energy, he blasted a spurt of flame, hoping to scare them away.</p>
			<p>But the creatures merely glowed brighter, seeming to suck in the heat of the fire.</p>
			<p>"What?" Tahu exclaimed. "So you like fire, eh, you stupid little pests? I'll show you fire!" He pointed his sword again, sending flame roaring out of the end of it. But once again, it only seemed to make the creatures stronger. The bridge, however, was glowing ominously as the stone started to melt beneath the intense heat.</p>
			<p>"Uh-oh," Tahu said with a gulp as lava dripped off into the abyss.</p>
			<p>The creatures were swarming thicker now, dozens of them clamping onto every part of his body.</p>
			<p><i>Must...get...away...</i> Tahu thought desperately as he tried to shake them off.</p>
			<p>How could he fight the scorpions? His best weapon-fire-seemed to be completely useless against them. And he was trapped on this bridge, forced to fight gravity and wind as well as the swarms of creatures.</p>
			<p>Suddenly Gali's voice floated into his head: <i>Our best weapon is our minds.</i> That was what she had said back in the clearing. At the time, Tahu had paid little attention to her words. Now, though, they burned within his mind. And with them, suddenly, came an idea.</p>
			<p>"Okay, pests," he said aloud. "Last chance to back off before it's too late. No takers? Oh, well, don't say I didn't warn you..."</p>
			<p>With that, he dropped his sword onto the bridge, then bent and grasped the stone with both hands. Flinging his feet off the edge, he let himself hang loose once again over the abyss.</p>
			<p>He closed his eyes, picturing Lewa. The Toa of Air seemed unable to stand still for more than a few seconds and had spent much of the time back at the clearing doing backflips and handstands. At one point, Tahu remembered, Lewa had even jumped up and grabbed onto an overhanging branch and swung himself around it by both hands, flipping around and around.</p>
			<p>Keeping that image in mind, Tahu swung his legs as vigorously as he could. It took a few tries, but finally he flung himself over the bridge and back around the other side. Gripping tightly with both hands, he pumped with his body, taking advantage of the momentum. He flipped around the narrow bridge again and again, building up speed.</p>
			<p>Tahu spun faster and faster, and before long, the scorpion creatures started losing their grip. One by one at first, then dozen by dozen, they flew away into the darkness.</p>
			<p><i>It's working!</i> he thought gleefully. <i>It's working! They can't hold on!</i></p>
			<p>Still he kept spinning, around and around, until he felt the last fiery wounds of the creatures' pinches fade away and could no longer hear their buzzing. Only then did he slow down enough to flip himself back upright onto the bridge.</p>
			<p><i>There,</i> he thought, breathing hard from the effort. <i>Even Lewa would be impressed by that.</i></p>
			<p>He glanced up and down the bridge. There was no sign of the warm in either direction. Then he felt a pinch and looked down to see that one scorpion creature had managed to hang on.</p>
			<p>"I think I can handle one of you," Tahu said, yanking the creature loose. "Time to go join your-wait a second. What's that?"</p>
			<p>He paused in the act of tossing the glowing creature into the chasm. What was on its head? Looking closer, he saw that it was wearing a tiny mask over its face. The mask was pitted and pockmarked. But it was a mask nonetheless.</p>
			<p>"Strange," he muttered, poking curiously at the mask with his finger.</p>
			<p>The small creature buzzed angrily, struggling against Tahu's grip. When his finger came close enough, it flung its pincers out and grabbed it, clamping down viciously.</p>
			<p>"Ow!" Tahu yanked his hand away, once again winding up to throw the little beast down and be done with it. But again, something made him hesitate. Why would a creature such as this wear a mask?</p>
			<p>He shifted his grip on the scorpion creature until he managed to trap its pincers within his hand. Then he used the other hand to carefully peel the little mask free.</p>
			<p>As soon as he did so, the creature went limp in his hand. For a second he thought he'd accidentally killed it. But then its legs waved weakly, and it chittered woozily up at him.</p>
			<p>He set the creature down on the bridge at his feet, being careful not to put his fingers within reach of its pincers. But he needn't have bothered with such caution. Showing no interest in him whatsoever, the little scorpion scurried quickly away down the bridge, disappearing a moment later into the darkness.</p>
			<p>Tahu blinked, wondering what that might mean. Had the creature run away because he'd removed its mask? Or because it had suddenly realized it was now all alone in its attack?</p>
			<p>He opened his hand, staring at the tiny mask. A gust of wind swooped past, nearly sending him off balance once again. It also swept the small mask off Tahu's palm and away into the chasm.</p>
			<p>Tahu grabbed for it-but it was too late. The mask was gone. Blowing out a sigh of frustration, he did his best to shrug off the loss. The important thing was that he'd defeated the scorpion creatures. Now he could continue with his quest.</p>
			<p>He picked up his sword. After all that had happened, the walk across the bridge no longer seemed quite so daunting, and it wasn't long before he was stepping onto the ledge.</p>
			<p>The mask was lying there waiting, its empty eyeholes staring up at him blankly. He picked it up and settled it on over his own mask.</p>
			<p>Energy exploded within him. He staggered forward, remembering the dropoff just in time to stop himself from stepping right over the edge.</p>
			<p>So much power! He looked around, seeing his surroundings with new eyes aided by the mask's powers of X-ray vision. Even in the near darkness he could see the veins of minerals buried within the stone walls around him, the trickles of water cutting through the solid rock beneath his feet.</p>
			<p>Tahu blinked, trying to get used to his new way of seeing. "Okay," he whispered to himself in awe. "Now we're getting somewhere..."</p>
			<h2>9. Cool As Ice</h2>
			<p>With every step, Kopaka cursed the heat, smoke, and choking ash of Ta-Wahi. Why did a Mask of Strength have to be hidden in such a place? He had no idea, and he hoped that the Matoran who had given him the tip had not led him astray.</p>
			<p>Pausing as another wave of heat overwhelmed him, Kopaka raised his ice blade to his neck, letting its welcome coldness revive him. How could anyone spend any time on this infernal volcano, let alone live there?</p>
			<p>An image of Tahu floated through his mind, and he grimaced. If the Toa of Fire could see him now, he would probably laugh his mask off.</p>
			<p><i>Of course, I'd like to see Tahu trying to get along in Ko-Wahi,</i> Kopaka thought. <i>He'd probably melt a hole in a glacier and spend so much energy yelling at the ice that he couldn't climb out.</i></p>
			<p>The thought amused him, giving him the strength to get moving again.</p>
			<p>After a few more minutes of climbing, he crested a peak and found himself overlooking an amazing landscape. He knew it had to be what he was looking for: the Lava Lagoon.</p>
			<p>Several of the slopes of the mountain met here, forming a deep, broad basin filled with lava. At least two hundred lengths across, the simmering lagoon glowed yellow and red and orange. A waterfall of lava poured into the far end, sending up constant sprays of steam and smoke.</p>
			<p>Kopaka looked around, wondering where in this bubbling wasteland a mask might be hidden.</p>
			<p>Then he noticed a small, craggy island jutting out of the center of the lagoon. Was the heat making him see things, or was that the gray shape of a Kanohi mask sitting on the island?</p>
			<p>He groaned. Why couldn't the mask have been guarded by another Rahi instead-or two, or twelve? He would rather face all the Rahi on Mata Nui at once than have to deal with this.</p>
			<p><i>Makuta showed quite a sense of humor when he hid these masks,</i> he thought grimly. <i>But I'll have the last laugh-no matter what it takes.</i></p>
			<p>Pointing his ice blade at the lagoon, Kopaka focused his energy.</p>
			<p><i>ZZZZZZZT!</i></p>
			<p>A small patch of lava froze-for about half a second. Then the ice cracked, steam escaped, and a moment later the frozen section had melted back into its original fiery form.</p>
			<p>Kopaka frowned and tried again. But his effort had little effect.</p>
			<p><i>Time for a new plan,</i> he thought. <i>If I can't go straight across, maybe I can go over.</i></p>
			<p>Changing his focus, he concentrated on the steam in the air over the lagoon. He aimed his ice blade toward it.</p>
			<p><i>ZZZZZZZT!</i></p>
			<p>The particles of moisture in the air froze solid, forming together into an icy bridge reaching over the first section of the lagoon.</p>
			<p><i>ZZZZZZZT!</i></p>
			<p><i>ZZZZZZZT!</i></p>
			<p>Kopaka felt his energy draining away as he pointed his blade again and again. But when he was finished, he smiled with triumph. His ice bridge stretched all the way across the lagoon to the island!</p>
			<p><i>Now all I have to do is go get that mask,</i> he thought, stepping onto the near end of the bridge. He hurried forward a few steps, then paused. What was that sound?</p>
			<p><i>Drip...SZZZZZ!...drip...SZZZZZ!...drip...SZZZZZ!</i></p>
			<p>Glancing down, he saw with alarm that the bridge was already melting away.</p>
			<p>"No!" he cried, pointing his blade toward it to refreeze it.</p>
			<p>But it was no use. As fast as he could refreeze one section, another melted. Within seconds the middle part of the bridge collapsed into the lagoon. Kopaka barely had enough time to leap back to shore as his section of the bridge collapsed, too.</p>
			<p>There had to be an answer. Turning the challenge over in his mind, Kopaka searched through his options.</p>
			<p>Finally, he had to admit the only likely solution: the other Toa. <i>If Tahu were here, he would have no trouble retrieving that mask,</i> Kopaka thought reluctantly.</p>
			<p>He shook his head, annoyed with himself. Why waste thought on a solution that wouldn't work? He had found two masks already without help from the other Toa. He could find a way to get this one without them as well.</p>
			<p>As he wandered toward the end of the little beach, Kopaka noticed a plume of steam coming from a crack in the rocky wall behind him. Unlike the sooty, smoky steam hovering over the lagoon itself, this steam looked pale and clean.</p>
			<p>Curious, Kopaka climbed up the rocky wall for a look. He soon discovered a hot-water spring bubbling up from the depths of the mountain.</p>
			<p>"Interesting..." he muttered.</p>
			<p>He glanced out toward the island where the mask lay, measuring the distance with his eyes. Then he stared again into the steaming spring. An idea was forming in his head.</p>
			<p>He analyzed the information again and again. The depth and size of the spring. The distance to the island. The probable heat of the lava.</p>
			<p>Still, he couldn't quite convince himself that it would work. The probability was fairly high, but nothing was certain...</p>
			<p>Kopaka clenched his fists as he imagined Tahu's mocking laughter, Lewa's perplexed glance. Neither of them would have the patience to waste so much time worrying over probabilities. Perhaps just this once he should live by their example.</p>
			<p><i>Besides, it's this or nothing,</i> Kopaka reminded himself. Of that, he was one hundred percent certain.</p>
			<p>Not giving himself time to doubt his decision, Kopaka pointed his blade.</p>
			<p><i>ZZZZZZZT!</i></p>
			<p>The spring froze solid.</p>
			<p>Kopaka smiled. As he had suspected, the water in the spring had been much cooler than the lava.</p>
			<p>Now came the hard part-getting the miniature iceberg out of its hollow and down the slope to the lagoon. Little by little, Kopaka froze and then chipped away the outer wall of the hollow, until all he had to do was push the large chunk of ice straight out and over the edge.</p>
			<p>There was no time to waste-the lava was already eating away at the edges of the ice floe. Without hesitating, Kopaka leaped down onto the ice.</p>
			<p>Using the blade as a paddle, he rowed toward the island with all his might. The ice continued to melt, but Kopaka kept his gaze focused on his goal.</p>
			<p>By the time he reached the rocky little ledge, his ice "boat" had melted away to about half its original size.</p>
			<p><i>More than half,</i> Kopaka told himself as he leaped onto the island and scooped up the mask. <i>It's still more than half there. That will be enough-especially with the added strength of my new Kanohi to help me row.</i> He jammed the Mask of Strength over his face, feeling its power seep through him.</p>
			<p>Still, he hesitated as he stepped back onto the floe. It would take him almost as long to row back to shore as it had taken to get here. Would the ice last that long?</p>
			<p><i>Just go!</i> he chided himself. <i>There's no other choice.</i></p>
			<p>Jabbing his blade into the lava, Kopaka put all the strength of his new mask into his effort as he pushed away from the island.</p>
			<p><i>I'll make it,</i> he told himself firmly, squashing the thought. <i>Whatever it takes, I'll do it. If the floe melts away too soon, maybe I can freeze enough of the lava to hop across the rest of the way a step at a time. Or-</i></p>
			<p>As he jabbed his blade into the lava again, he misjudged and hit the edge of the floe instead. The force of the blow sent several large chunks of ice flying-one straight toward him! The Ice Toa didn't have time to dodge it. The ice chunk connected solidly with the side of his head, knocking him to his knees.</p>
			<p>He clung woozily to the ice, fighting to retain consciousness. But darkness seeped out from the corners of his mind...and then, suddenly, an intense vision overwhelmed him, sweeping away the floe, the lagoon, the heat, and everything else.</p>
			<p>First he found himself looking with a bird's-eye view over all of Mata Nui. The image suddenly rushed closer, almost as if he were falling straight toward the slopes of Mount Ihu in the center of the island. The image shifted slightly to one side, swooping down one of the mountain's slopes until it reached a large clearing. There, Kopaka saw a great temple built out of stone.</p>
			<p>Then a strange, echoing voice spoke out of the darkness. <i>"Welcome, Toa of Ice,"</i> it said, fading in and out as Kopaka struggled to free himself from the vision. <i>"Do not be...your mind can journey to...behold the future of...you and the others shall...all the Great Masks of Power...together and defeat...three shall become...path of wisdom...myself, Akamai...of the warrior...only by uniting...farewell..."</i></p>
			<p>With that, Kopaka's mind snapped back to reality. He found himself on his hands and knees on the floe, still clutching at the rapidly shrinking chunk of ice.</p>
			<p><i>That little accident was bad luck on top of bad judgement,</i> he thought bleakly as he finally faced the truth-the ice floe wasn't going to make it back to shore. That meant he had two choices: Try the frozen-footstep method, or wait as long as he could and then attempt an enormous leap to solid ground.</p>
			<p>He decided that the second plan had a more likely chance of success. But the distance to shore seemed impossibly far...</p>
			<p>Kopaka reminded himself that he now wore the Great Mask of Strength. Perhaps it would give his legs the extra power they would need to propel him such a tremendous distance. Perhaps...</p>
			<p>Gathering his strength, Kopaka got into position and then waited. One long moment, then another, then another, coolly patient as he gauged the footing beneath him. All he needed was enough to push off from-</p>
			<p>"Now!" he shouted, leaping forward with all his might. The energy of the Pakari flowed through him, giving him extra strength.</p>
			<p>But it wouldn't be enough.</p>
			<p><i>That Great Mask of Levitation would come in awfully handy right now,</i> he thought bleakly as he felt himself start to fall toward the bubbling lava.</p>
			<p>"Kopaka!" a voice shouted from the direction of the shore.</p>
			<p>Kopaka glanced forward, but saw only a flash of green as he suddenly felt himself caught up in a blast of wind.</p>
			<p>"Aaaaaaah!" he cried as he flew helplessly through the air.</p>
			<p><i>CRASH!</i></p>
			<p>He smashed into the ground face first.</p>
			<p>"Sorryoops, brother," Lewa's voice said from somewhere nearby. "I didn't have thought-time to plan a softer landing."</p>
			<p>"Ugh," Kopaka groaned. Every limb in his body ached. But he was still in one piece-and unmelted! "It's all right, brother Lewa," he added, realizing that it was Lewa's wind gust that had saved him. "I owe you one. I shall not forget this."</p>
			<p>"Anytime, brother," Lewa said. "And at least I see you got a mask out of it."</p>
			<p>Kopaka nodded, touching the new Kanohi on his face. He wondered if the should tell the other Toa about his vision. What had it meant? Who had sent it? Was it a foreshadowing of something important-or merely a trick sent by Makuta?</p>
			<p><i>Whatever it was, it nearly got me boiled,</i> he reminded himself. <i>Isn't that the best evidence of all that it must have come from Makuta?</i></p>
			<p>Disturbed by the thought, he remained silent about his vision as Lewa chattered on about finding his own Great Mask of Strength in Onu-Wahi.</p>
			<p>"Had to fight a nastyugly Rahi to get it, too," he said cheerfully. "But I suppose it was worth it-gave that quickbreeze I sent you some extra oomph."</p>
			<p>Kopaka nodded. "These Rahi-they seem to stop at nothing to guard these masks."</p>
			<p>"Oh, this fellow quickstopped as soon as I knocked off its own mask," Lewa said. "It panicfled into the depths of the tunnels everquick."</p>
			<p>"Really? Hmm." Kopaka filed that away in his mind. It could be useful to him later.</p>
			<p>That reminded him-he still had masks to find. "My thanks to you again, brother Lewa," he said with a formal little bow. "Now I must take my leave and continue my search."</p>
			<p>"Oh! I almost mindlost why I came looking for you in the first place," Lewa cried. "I just luckymet Onua and Pohatu downmountain. Onua has called a meeting."</p>
			<p>Kopaka frowned. "But I haven't found all my masks yet."</p>
			<p>"None of us has." Lewa shrugged. "We're all learnfinding that this searchquest is trickier than we thought. That's why Onua wants to get together. I'm not one for groupworking, but I think he may be right. We need to compare notes, do some teamplanning."</p>
			<p>Kopaka opened his mouth to protest again, but shut it before speaking a word. How much time might he have saved just now if he'd had Lewa along in the first place-or Tahu, or Onua?</p>
			<p>He sighed. As much as he hated the idea of joining in on some big, happy, crowded Toa-fest, the facts were staring him in the face. The mission would be more successful if the Toa attacked it as a team.</p>
			<p>"All right," Kopaka said at last. "Let's go."</p>
			<h2>10. The Temple</h2>
			<p>Gali was very glad that Onua's meeting had gone more smoothly than the last. It had ended in one unanimous decision: The Toa would work as a team.</p>
			<p>Each of the Toa had encountered at least one Rahi during their travels, and Gali was no exception. After encountering another of the monstrous swimming Rahi she'd seen just after her awakening, she respected the creatures' power more than ever. She now knew that such beasts were known as Tarakava. The Turaga had told them that all the Rahi were native beasts of the island-controlled by Makuta to do his dark bidding.</p>
			<p><i>Perhaps when we've found all the masks, we'll also find a way to set the Rahi free,</i> Gali thought.</p>
			<p>She only wished that the mission were going more smoothly. They had wasted too much time on petty disagreements. Lewa kept getting distracted and wandering away from the group. Tahu seemed determined to completely disable every Rahi they encountered. Kopaka periodically got fed up with the bickering and threatened to go off again on his own.</p>
			<p>Through it all, Gali did her best to maintain the peace. She could tell that Onua was working toward the same goal in a quieter way and found her respect for the strong, reserved Toa of Earth growing more and more. Now, as they approached the shoreline just south of Po-Koro, she glanced toward him.</p>
			<p>"Onua," she said. "If what the Ta-Matoran told us is accurate, we will need to go beneath the waters to retrieve Tahu's levitation mask."</p>
			<p>Lewa overheard her and groaned. "Not again!" he cried. "I already took one wetdive to get my Mask of Speed. I still haven't got all the wateryuck out of my ears!"</p>
			<p>"Don't be foolish," Kopaka spoke up. "Obviously, only those among us who already hold the Kanohi Kaukau should go on from here. Pohatu, Lewa, Tahu-you can wait on the beach."</p>
			<p>Tahu glared at him. "Thanks for pointing out the obvious," he retorted. "But it's my mask we're after here-my villager was the one who revealed its location. I think I should be the one to decide whether or not I go."</p>
			<p>Gali rolled her eyes. "It would be helpful to have several of us standing guard on the beach, brother Tahu," she pointed out.</p>
			<p>"That's true," Tahu admitted, though he still shot Kopaka an irritated glance. "Go with good fortune, Gali. We'll keep a careful watch for danger while we wait here for your return."</p>
			<p>Onua was already leading the way into the surf, with Kopaka a step behind. Gali followed, feeling some of her anxiety wash away at the touch of the warm, familiar water. She dove into the waves, swimming quickly out into deeper water.</p>
			<p>Soon the three of them reached the broad, open sweep of the sea valley.</p>
			<p>Kopaka pointed to a large, shadowy shape visible in the water. Gali shuddered as she recognized the Tarakava.</p>
			<p>"I escaped from one Tarakava by blinding it with waving seaweed, and from another by luring it into a cave where it got stuck," Gali told the others. "These Rahi are strong, but not very clever, I think. All we need is a plan..."</p>
			<p>Soon the three of them were swimming slowly toward the Tarakava. A moment later the creature spotted them and let out a roar.</p>
			<p>"Okay, it knows we're here," Gali whispered, floating in place. "Kopaka, get ready."</p>
			<p>The Ice Toa nodded. The Tarakava barreled toward them. Soon it was only a short distance away, then colser...Still Kopaka didn't move.</p>
			<p>Gali held her breath. The beast would be upon them within seconds.</p>
			<p>As she was about to cry out, the Ice Toa finally made his move. With a twitch of his ice blade, he sent a blast of intense cold out ahead of him, instantly freezing the water-and the Tarakava-into a solid block of ice.</p>
			<p>"Nice work!" Onua cried, his deep voice rumbling through the water like an earthquake. "Now it's my turn..."</p>
			<p>With that, he struck the sandy ocean floor with his fists. The ground swelled up, arcing over the giant Tarakava ice cube until it completely surrounded the frozen area.</p>
			<p>"That should hold it for a while," Gali said, relieved. "Now all we have to do is-"</p>
			<p>"Wait," Onua interrupted, staring at the Tarakava, whose head protruded out of the dirt-and-ice mound that trapped it. "I just want to see something..."</p>
			<p>He swam toward the creature, carefully staying out of range of its jaws. Patting the dirt mound before him, he caused it to burst upward in a small explosion, knocking the Tarakava's mask from its face.</p>
			<p>The creature's violent spasms stopped immediately. After a moment it let out a wail of dismay and started to wiggle again, but this time it completely ignored Onua.</p>
			<p>"I thought that might happen," Onua said. "When Pohatu and I encountered a pair of Nui-Rama, he knocked off the masks of one of them. The creature suddenly changed-flew away instead of continuing the fight."</p>
			<p>Kopaka nodded thoughtfully. "Something similar happened when I met a Kuma-Nui on my way to Po-Wahi."</p>
			<p>"I wish I'd mentioned it earlier," Onua said. "I didn't realize it might be important-until just now."</p>
			<p>Gali noticed that Kopaka didn't make the same apology. "We have learned something important here, I think," she said. "It is through these masks that Makuta controls the Rahi." Noticing the gray shape of a mask against the white sand nearby, she darted forward to scoop it up.</p>
			<p>"Mission accomplished," Onua said. "Come on, let's get back."</p>
			<p>"Don't be stupid," Kopaka snapped. "You'll only end up killing yourself-and making a mess for the rest of us to clean up."</p>
			<p>Pohatu sighed, wondering if it had been a mistake to split into two groups. If Onua or Gali were here, maybe one of them could settle this argument between Kopaka and Lewa. But they, along with Tahu, had gone to Le-Wahi in search of Pohatu's second-to-last mask.</p>
			<p>Now Pohatu stood atop the highest bluff in his own home region, staring at the mask that hung tantalizingly halfway down the sheer rock face. At the bottom of the cliff was an enormous Nui-Jaga. The Rahi knew the Toa were there-every few seconds, it turned its masked face toward them and rattled its tail stinger.</p>
			<p>"Perhaps our icy brother is right, Lewa," Pohatu suggested. "If you miss your mark and fall-well, anyway, I'm sure we can find another way if we put our minds together."</p>
			<p>Lewa shrugged, his smile never faltering. "Why worrybother?" he said. "After all, this way is so much more funnnnnnnnnn..."</p>
			<p>The last word was lost in a rush of movement as Lewa launched himself off of the cliff with both arms outstretched.</p>
			<p>"That fool!" Kopaka muttered savagely.</p>
			<p>Pohatu couldn't speak. He could only hold his breath, hardly daring to watch. It was his own Kanohi Kaukau that Lewa was trying to grab as he swept past-how could Pohatu live with himself if Lewa's bold attempt ended in catastrophe?</p>
			<p>"Wheeeeeee!" Lewa cried, snatching the mask in one hand as he swooped past, then sweeping one arm through the air to call the wind to his aid. The sudden gust that resulted gave him a quick lift. But he soon left the wind behind, floating upward on his own power.</p>
			<p>"He uses the Mask of Levitation well," Kopaka admitted grudgingly as he watched the grinning Lewa ascend toward them.</p>
			<p>Pohatu shot a glance at the Ice Toa. Beneath all his coldness, Kopaka had an honest heart.</p>
			<p>A second later Lewa landed beside them. "One Kanohi Kaukau, as ordered," he said breathlessly, tossing the mask to Pohatu. "Hope it fits, because I'd sorryhate to have to return it."</p>
			<p>	*	*	*</p>
			<p>Onua squinted uncertainly toward the treetops. The sun was bright here in the rain forest of Le-Wahi, and his eyes ached with the effort of trying to see through its brightness.</p>
			<p>"Is that it?" he asked Gali and Tahu, who stood beside him.</p>
			<p>Gali nodded. "It is a Kanohi Kakama," she confirmed. "It seems to be stuck in the knot of this tree, up near the top. Too bad brother Lewa isn't here to play monkey for us."</p>
			<p>"Indeed. Sister, you hold the Mask of Levitation-do you think you can get it?"</p>
			<p>"I can try." Gali stared upward. "I haven't yet had much time to practice. But if I move slowly..."</p>
			<p>Tahu let out a noisy, impatient sigh. "Look, we don't have all day for this," he said abruptly. "Why not try an easier way?"</p>
			<p>With that, he pointed his sword at the tree.</p>
			<p>"Tahu, no!" Gali cried.</p>
			<p>But even as the words left her mouth, flames shot out of Tahu's sword and enveloped the tree's trunk. Within seconds the fire had consumed the entire tree, burning it into a black skeleton sprouting from a pile of cinders. Only the mask remained untouched by the flame, falling intact to the ground with a puff of embers.</p>
			<p>Onua frowned as he picked up the mask. <i>He'll set the whole forest ablaze!</i> he thought, as runaway flames licked at several neighboring trees.</p>
			<p>Beside him, he saw Gali gesturing with her arms. A moment later, a drenching rain shower poured down over them, dousing all the fires.</p>
			<p>"Thanks," Tahu said, wiping rainwater from his mask. "I didn't think the fire would spread."</p>
			<p>"Right." Gali's voice sounded almost cold enough to have come from Kopaka. "I suppose you also didn't think about the birds who called that tree home, or the plants and animals that relied on it for shade. In other words, you didn't <i>think.</i>"</p>
			<p>With that, she turned and stalked off into the jungle.</p>
			<p>	*	*	*</p>
			<p>"There!" Tahu crowed triumphantly as the demasked Rahi scurried away down the drifts of lower Mount Ihu. "The Great Mask of Water Breathing is mine. And that means-"</p>
			<p>"-all the masks have been found," Kopaka finished for him.</p>
			<p>"Good," Gali said shortly, hardly smiling at Tahu's obvious glee as he placed the Kanohi Kaukau over his face and the dull gray surface of the mask suddenly gleamed bright red.</p>
			<p>Kopaka was strangely pleased to notice that Gali and Tahu didn't seem to be getting along. He wondered what had happened between them, though he wasn't about to ask.</p>
			<p>"Now we come to the next question," Onua said. "What are we supposed to do now?"</p>
			<p>Tahu shrugged. "We have all our powers now," he pointed out. "So let's go take out the rest of the Rahi. Now that we know how to disable them-"</p>
			<p>"Seems like timefoolery to me," Lewa interrupted. "The Matoran know the secret now, too. With that knowledge, they should be able to safekeep themselves against the Rahi for the nowtime. And I have a hunchthought that other tasks lay in store for us."</p>
			<p>Kopaka winced at the Air Toa's comment. Didn't anyone else recognize how absurd it was to rely on hunches and premonitions? At the same time, though, he couldn't help flashing back to the vision he'd had on the Lava Lagoon.</p>
			<p>Did it have some kind of meaning, or was he turning into a foolish dream-follower like Lewa himself?</p>
			<p>"Perhaps our next duty has to do with the golden-colored Kanohi my Turaga mentioned," Gali said. "Does anyone know anything more about them?"</p>
			<p>"Not I," Onua said as the others shook their heads. "What exactly were you told?"</p>
			<p>"Not much." Gali frowned, looking puzzled and frustrated. "I-I suppose we will have to go back and ask. All I really know is that somehow, we are supposed to find such a golden mask."</p>
			<p>Finally Kopaka spoke up. "I think I know where we might find it," he said quietly.</p>
			<p>The others glanced at him in surprise. "Huh?" Tahu said. "What are you talking about?"</p>
			<p>"I had a vision," Kopaka said. "Right before you found me on the Lava Lagoon, brother Lewa." He glanced at the Air Toa, who had stopped leaping around for once. "In it, I saw a temple-a huge temple at the center of the island. I think we're meant to go there."</p>
			<p>Tahu snorted. "And when exactly were you going to let us in on this secret?"</p>
			<p>"He just did, Tahu," Gali pointed out quietly. "And that's fine. There was no need of knowing it until now."</p>
			<p>Kopaka gazed at her, touched that she'd come to his defense. <i>It's just because she's annoyed with Tahu over something or other,</i> he told himself.</p>
			<p>Still, he couldn't help giving her a brief, grateful smile.</p>
			<p>"It looks just as it did in my vision," Kopaka murmured, sounding surprised.</p>
			<p>The others were already exclaiming over the grand temple. But Onua's mind turned immediately to more practical matters.</p>
			<p>"Look," he said, pointing to the life-size carvings of the six Toa cut out of the temple walls, complete except that the carvings wore no masks at all. "Are you thinking what I'm thinking?"</p>
			<p>"I am, if you're thinking our masks would fit perfectly over these carved faces," Tahu said, ripping off his Kanohi Kaukau and holding it over the carved Tahu figure.</p>
			<p>"Wait!" Kopaka said. "Let's not throw away our powers foolishly."</p>
			<p>Tahu frowned at him. "Who says we're throwing them away?" he challenged him. "It was your vision that led us here. Now you say we're being foolish?"</p>
			<p>"That's not what I meant," Kopaka said.</p>
			<p>Gali placed a hand on Kopaka's arm. "It's okay, brother," she said. "I think Tahu is on the right track-this time."</p>
			<p>"Thank you, sister Gali." Tahu smiled at her. "I appreciate the support."</p>
			<p>Gali smiled back, and Kopaka scowled in irritation. Whatever had been bothering those two earlier seemed to be over. Kopaka opened his mouth to argue further, but something stopped him.</p>
			<p><i>Maybe this isn't the wrong thing to do just because it seems impulsive,</i> he thought. Then he frowned. <i>What am I doing? Am I turning into Lewa or Gali, trusting passing whims and feelings?</i></p>
			<p>Tahu pushed his mask onto the stone Tahu's face. As the mask melted into the stone, he pulled off his Kanohi Miru, and then his other masks, placing each one onto the carving's face.</p>
			<p>Lewa and Pohatu followed Tahu's lead. Even Gali stepped forward toward her sculpture, her Kanohi Akaku in hand.</p>
			<p>Onua glanced over at Kopaka. "Normally I, like you, would be against this rush to move," he commented. "But I'm getting the strangest feeling that this is what we are meant to do."</p>
			<p>Kopaka nodded. "I-I, too, am beginning to get that feeling."</p>
			<p>That was enough for Onua. He had already observed enough to know that the Ice Toa wasn't one to make rash decisions-not without good reason, anyway.</p>
			<p>The two of them walked over to their own likenesses. Onua pulled off his Kanohi Kakama. Taking a deep breath, he set it into place on the stone Toa's face. The stone seemed to suck it in, swallowing it into itself. Onua fed it another mask, and another. Soon he was placing his last mask onto the carving. It melted into the carving like the others but remained visible, tinting the stone black. Without any mask at all, Onua's face felt strange and vulnerable.</p>
			<p>For a moment, nothing happened. Onua felt his heart sink. Had they just given away their Masks of Power for no good reason? Had this all been a trick of Makuta?</p>
			<p>Then there was a peal of sound, like great bells blended with laughter. Onua gasped in amazement as a new mask suddenly appeared on the face of each stone carving-a golden Kanohi, glowing with light and power.</p>
			<p>Onua carefully lifted the golden Kanohi from the carving's face and placed it on his own. He staggered back a step as waves of power blasted through him. Then he smiled. This new mask united all the powers of the other six-only it was even stronger!</p>
			<p>"So this was what we were really seeking," Gali said, sounding awed. "Now we truly have the power to take on the Makuta..."</p>
			<p>Her last few words were nearly drowned out by a mighty rumble from somewhere deep within the earth. The Toa jumped back as a group, even as the ground began to shake and groan beneath their feet.</p>
			<p>A chasm yawned open in front of them, right in the middle of the main temple area. It turned into a tunnel about two lengths wide.</p>
			<p>Then everything stopped. The earth lay still again, as if nothing had happened.</p>
			<p>The Toa stared at the hole in the ground. Then they stared at one another. There was a moment of silence.</p>
			<p>Finally Onua spoke.</p>
			<p>"Come on," he said, stepping toward the tunnel. "I guess we'd better see where this goes."</p>
			<h2>11. Into The Darkness</h2>
			<p>Lewa's heart pounded with anticipation as the Toa made their way down the tunnel. But after so much confusion and uncertainty, it felt good to have a plan at last.</p>
			<p><i>Follow tunnel,</i> he thought. <i>Find Makuta. Destroy Makuta. Sounds plainsimple enough...</i></p>
			<p>The tunnel twisted and turned through the earth, traveling deeper and deeper. Tahu's sword cast enough of a glow to light their way, though deep, ominous shadows still lurked ahead.</p>
			<p>Finally Tahu let out a shout as he turned a corner. "Hurry!" he cried. "I think we've found it."</p>
			<p>"What?" Lewa skidded around the corner and stopped.</p>
			<p>They were in a cavern, broad and long. Thick slashes of lightstone in the walls cast an eerie pale glow over the place. At the far end, an immense iron door filled most of the wall. Several other passageways snaked off in various directions along the sides of the cave, but Lewa didn't spare them a glance. His eyes were trained on that giant door.</p>
			<p>"That's it," he whispered in awe. "That's where we'll find Makuta."</p>
			<p>Nobody answered, but he could feel that they were all in agreement. Tahu gripped his sword tightly. "All right, then," he said. "If he's in there, let's go in and get him."</p>
			<p>"Tahu, wait," Pohatu protested. "We can't just rush in there without a plan, or-"</p>
			<p><i>SKREEEEEE!</i></p>
			<p>A piercing shriek filled the room, echoing wildly. Whirling around, Lewa saw a pair of monstrous Rahi skittering out of two side passageways. They were immense, broad and squat but surprisingly fast. Their powerful arms ended in dangerous-looking pincers.</p>
			<p>"What are those?" Pohatu cried.</p>
			<p>Lewa gasped, recognizing the creatures from a Turaga's description. "Manas. I rememberthink they're called Manas."</p>
			<p>"They're just more Rahi," Tahu shouted, already swinging his fire sword. "Nothing we can't handle. Come on!"</p>
			<p>Lewa hesitated-the Turaga had warned them that no single Toa could hope to take on the Manas. But perhaps together...He somersaulted through the air toward one of the creatures, landing on its back. He grabbed it and tried to flip it over, but it was larger than he'd expected and tossed im off easily.</p>
			<p>"Oof!" he grunted, landing hard on the stone floor.</p>
			<p>He leaped back into the fray, joining Tahu and Onua as they battled furiously against one of the Manas. Pohatu raced past, pausing long enough to whisper in Lewa's ear.</p>
			<p>"Gali has set a trap," he said. "Help me lead the Manas toward that small tunnel back there."</p>
			<p>Lewa nodded. Pohatu let out a whoop and raced to the back of the cave. Lewa jumped forward and smacked the nearby Manas on its shell-like back before somersaulting away. "Catch me if you can, uglypincher!" he taunted.</p>
			<p>The Manas paused, turning toward him. But then it returned its attention to Onua, snapping at him with its deadly claws.</p>
			<p>"This way, brother," Lewa shouted, waving his arms at Onua. "Run this way."</p>
			<p>Onua managed to dodge the creature's blows and raced toward Lewa. "What is it, brother?" he asked breathlessly.</p>
			<p>"A plan," Lewa told him. "Come on, we need to lead them this way."</p>
			<p>Nearby, he saw that Kopaka was doing his best to lure the second Manas in the same direction. He wielded his ice blade coolly, backing up a few steps each time the Manas lunged at him. Beside him, Gali served as a distraction whenever the creature seemed to be getting the better of the Ice Toa.</p>
			<p>Step by step, the six Toa led the Manas toward the tunnel. Lewa glanced behind him, noting the water lapping at the mouth of the tunnel. He didn't know the details of the plan, but he could guess them.</p>
			<p><i>If we can get this monsterpair trapped in that tunnel, sister Gali can ask the waters to awaycarry them,</i> he thought. <i>Then we can stoneblock the tunnel, and get back to finding Makuta.</i></p>
			<p>Lewa felt his body quivering with eagerness to move, but he forced himself to wait. They had to act together, or the plan would fail.</p>
			<p>When Gali spoke, it was a single word. "Now," she said.</p>
			<p>The Toa acted all at once. Lewa, Tahu, Pohatu, and Onua rushed forward and leaped past or over the two Manas, putting the creatures between themselves and the tunnel. Meanwhile, Gali rushed closer to the tunnel's entrance, and the waters within started to churn.</p>
			<p><i>But what is our icebrother doing?</i> Lewa wondered even as he began to swing his blade at the Manas, driving them back.</p>
			<p>He soon understood. As the water in the tunnel entrance splashed out onto the cavern floor, Kopaka pointed his ice blade at it, freezing it solid. Soon a slick coating of ice covered much of the floor between the Manas and the tunnel. Once the creatures reached the ice, it would be easier to push them into the watery trap.</p>
			<p>"Almost there!" Tahu shouted. "Come on, brothers! Let's finish this!"</p>
			<p>Lewa leaped forward again, swinging at the closer of the two Manas. The creature hissed furiously, striking back with deadly accuracy. Its claw struck the Air Toa on the shoulder, sending him rocketing backward.</p>
			<p>Ignoring the pain in his shoulder, he leaped back into action. The Manas took another step backward, then another...until it finally hit the ice.</p>
			<p>"Push!" Tahu howled, hurling himself at the creature. By this time Kopaka had joined the fighters, and the five of them leaped at the two Manas, shoving them toward Gali's tunnel.</p>
			<p>Lewa could see the creatures' claws striking his comrades again and again-he felt powerful blows land on his own body. But he ignored the pain. All that mattered was the plan...</p>
			<p>The Manas skittered across the ice, heading straight toward the tunnel.</p>
			<p>"Come on!" Tahu shouted, pointing his fire sword at the ground to melt the ice that now lay between the Toa and their quarry. "Don't give them a chance to escape."</p>
			<p>But before the Toa could reach the Manas to give them a last push into the cave, the two crablike creatures spun toward each other. Hissing loudly, each of them reached out its claws, locking them together until they seemed to merge into one even more enormous creature.</p>
			<p>"Oh, no!" Onua cried. "Look at them-they're too big for the tunnel now!"</p>
			<p>"They're working together," Kopaka said grimly. "I didn't think the Rahi were capable of such intelligence."</p>
			<p>Pohatu shook his head. "These manas creatures are not ordinary Rahi."</p>
			<p>Lewa was already leaping into action. "We are not planlost yet," he cried. "I'll separate them if I can..."</p>
			<p>Without waiting for a reply, Lewa somersaulted forward. He crashed headlong into the tangle of claws that held the two Manas together.</p>
			<p>The creatures let out a furious hiss. Acting together, they swung their joined claws outward, sending Lewa flying across the cave. He smashed against the wall and landed in a heap, dazed.</p>
			<p>As he climbed to his feet, he saw the paired Manas bounce off of the too-small tunnel entrance. Soon they had rocketed back across the remains of the ice onto dry ground. There, they separated and returned their attention to the surprised Toa.</p>
			<p><i>These are no ordinary Rahi,</i> Lewa thought as he saw the Manas' pincer land a powerful blow on Tahu, knocking him into the wall. <i>No ordinary Rahi at all.</i></p>
			<h2>12. The Power Of Six</h2>
			<p>Kopaka saw Tahu fly by and crash into the wall. As the Fire Toa slid to the floor, stunned, Kopaka aimed his ice blade in front of the Manas that was moving in on the fallen Toa. The floor in front of the creature instantly froze once again, slowing it down long enough for Lewa to somersault in and drag Tahu out of range.</p>
			<p>"This is ridiculous," Gali cried as she defended herself against the second Manas. "They're just too strong! We'd better retreat."</p>
			<p>"Never!" Tahu croaked, his voice hoarse but determined. "We must stay united. We must defeat them!"</p>
			<p>Kopaka blinked, wondering why Tahu's words had struck such a chord in his mind. <i>Where have I heard something like that before?</i></p>
			<p>He glanced toward Gali and found her watching him. "What is it, brother?" she asked. "Do you know something? I-I think I do. I had a vision. It told me that something would happen after we found all the Masks of Power. That we would need to-unite."</p>
			<p>Kopaka hesitated. Could it be?</p>
			<p>The words from his vision returned:<i>...behold the future...you and the others shall...all the Great Masks of Power...together and defeat...three shall become...path of wisdom...myself, Akamai...of the warrior...only by uniting...</i></p>
			<p>"I think I had the same vision," he admitted at last. "I didn't understand it at the time. I-I still don't understand it."</p>
			<p>"Don't you see?" Gali stared into his eyes, almost seeming to forget about the Manas, who were attacking the other Toa nearby. "I was told that three shall become Wairuha and walk the path of wisdom. Three shall become Akamai and walk the path of the warrior. Only by uniting will the Toa find the strength to triumph."</p>
			<p>Kopaka shook his head. "No," he said. "It doesn't make sense. How could such a thing happen?"</p>
			<p>"I sense that it will happen if we want it to," Gali replied quietly. She glanced briefly toward the battle behind them. "I'm thinking that <i>I</i> want whatever will help us all. Do you?"</p>
			<p>Kopaka stared at her for a moment. How could he want such a thing? Three become one-it would mean giving up his own individuality. No! It was impossible...</p>
			<p>Or was it? <i>Haven't I found that sometimes my own powers fell short?</i> he thought reluctantly. <i>Haven't I found myself wishing at times that the others were with me?</i></p>
			<p>Gali was still watching him. "Unity, duty, destiny," she said urgently. "Think about those words, brother. Do you believe in them?"</p>
			<p>"Yes," Kopaka said at last. "Yes. I don't like them much right now, but I believe in them." He took a deep breath. "Let's do it."</p>
			<p>"Brothers!" Gali shouted. "We need to retreat-just for a moment."</p>
			<p>Pohatu and Onua glanced at each other. Then they used their powers simultaneously to tumble down part of the ceiling and create a wall of rubble right in front of the advancing Manas.</p>
			<p>"That won't hold them for long," Pohatu said breathlessly. "Now, what is it?"</p>
			<p>Gali quickly described the vision she'd had. "We need to unite," she finished. "Combine our powers. Otherwise, there is no hope of victory."</p>
			<p>The others nodded. "At this point," Tahu said, "I'll try anything."</p>
			<p>As if part of one of his own dreams, Kopaka moved toward Gali and Lewa. Nearby, Tahu turned to face Pohatu and Onua. In each group, three Toa locked eyes...and became one.</p>
			<h2>13. The Toa Unite</h2>
			<p>The two Toa Kaita were a worthy match for the powerful Manas, and this time, the battle raged more furiously than ever.</p>
			<p>Akamai fended off one with a series of powerful blows. "What, you scurry away like a tiny Hoto bug?" he cried with a roar of laughter.</p>
			<p>"Do not taunt them, Akamai," Wairuha said. "Remember that they are unwilling servants of Makuta. Let us finish this quickly."</p>
			<p>The words had hardly left his mouth when one of the Manas leaped at him. Despite his immense strength, the strike sent Wairuha staggering backward a few steps as the enemy clamped its pincers onto him. Using all of his strength, Wairuha managed to rip the Manas free and fling him against the wall.</p>
			<p>The Manas hit the stone with a solid crunch. But it recovered quickly and skittered back toward the battle.</p>
			<p>Turning toward the Manas that was scurrying toward him, Wairuha sucked in a deep breath, feeling his powers-of ice, water, and wind-expand and merge within him. A moment later, a raging blizzard erupted in the cavern.</p>
			<p>Akamai, too, was using his combined powers. A giant crater exploded in the cavern floor, spraying stone, earth, and lava in every direction. Another crater appeared, and another, until the Manas were trapped on an island of solid floor surrounded by a moat of boiling lava.</p>
			<p>Wairuha focused his energy through the blizzard, controlling it. He concentrated with everything he had-logic, instinct, and impulse guiding him all at once. Soon he had compressed the might of the storm into a single, focused beam of pure cold energy.</p>
			<p>He turned it toward the trapped Manas. As the beam passed over them, the creatures froze solid.</p>
			<p>"Nice work, brother," Akamai said. "But I fear it will take more than that to kill them."</p>
			<p>Wairuha was already moving toward the lava moat. "There is no need to kill them, brother," he said. With one acrobatic leap, he crossed the moat and stood beside the frozen Manas. "I'll need your assistance to remove these masks."</p>
			<p>Akamai nodded and leaped over as well. Touching one finger to the mask of one of the Manas, he soon melted the ice surrounding it. Wairuha reached out and pulled it free, dropping it into the lava, where it sank out of sight.</p>
			<p>The Toa Kaita turned to the other Manas, repeating the process. Soon both Manas were free of their controlling masks.</p>
			<p>"There," Wairuha said, leaping back across the moat. "That takes care of that."</p>
			<p>"Not quite." Akamai bent and touched the ground at the edge of the lava moat. There was a rumble, as the edges moved toward each other, closing off the moat as if it had never existed.</p>
			<p>Wairuha looked around. Except for the frozen forms of the Mans, the cave looked as empty and peaceful as when the Toa had arrived.</p>
			<p>"Our work is done," he said. "And now..."</p>
			<p>He felt his mind slipping away, as if in the moment just before sleep. He closed his eyes...</p>
			<p>Tahu opened his eyes. <i>Is it really me?</i> he wondered.</p>
			<p>Yes. He was himself again. Becoming part of Toa Kaita Akamai had been electrifying, but it was nice to have his own mind and will to himself again.</p>
			<p>Glancing around, he saw the other Toa standing nearby, all of them looking as dazed as he himself felt.</p>
			<p>Lewa was the first to speak. "Well," he said, stretching and bending. "That was a powerfeeling that you don't get every day."</p>
			<p>Laughter bubbled from Gali like a spring. "Brothers," she cried, stretching her arms wide. "We did it! We became a part of something larger-and did what we never could have done otherwise."</p>
			<h2>14. Out Of The Shadows</h2>
			<p>"Quicklook!" Toa Lewa cried, pointing across the huge underground cavern. "The Manas are thawing. Once Makuta sees his hardluck creatures running for their lives, he'll be out of our way everquick."</p>
			<p>Pohatu glanced where the Are Toa was pointing. He and the other five Toa watched as the mask-free Manas thawed from the deep freeze that Toa Kaita Wairuha's icy power had put them in and scuttled away, disappearing into the darkness of a nearby tunnel.</p>
			<p>It had been a hard-fought victory for the Toa. A moment worthy of celebration. Somehow, though, Pohatu found it impossible to relax and enjoy it. There was something-a shudder of stone against stone, the faintest tremor in the rocky ground-that told him there might be more to come.</p>
			<p>The Toa of Earth was thinking along much the same lines. "Don't be so certain that we have truly defeated the Great Evil One," Onua warned Lewa solemnly. "While these Manas were powerful, they were but guardians. Makuta himself-"</p>
			<p>"What's that?" Gali interrupted. The Water Toa was staring intently toward the back of the cavern. "Something moved back there. Onua, can you see anything?"</p>
			<p>Kopaka peered into the darkness along with the others, gripping his ice blade uneasily.</p>
			<p><i>Drip. Drip.</i></p>
			<p>Water trickled onto stone somewhere far off-or was it nearby? Down here it was hard to tell.</p>
			<p>"Does anyone see anything?" Lewa's whisper broke the near silence.</p>
			<p>"Shh!" Gali chided him. "Did you hear-"</p>
			<p><i>CREEEAAAAAAAAAAK!</i></p>
			<p>The sudden sound exploded through the cave.</p>
			<p>"<i>Toa...</i>"</p>
			<p>Pohatu spun around. Had he really just heard that whisper?</p>
			<p>"<i>Toa...</i>"</p>
			<p>"Who is it?" Tahu called boldly. "Who's there? Step forward and reveal yourself at once, or suffer the wrath of Toa Tahu!"</p>
			<p>Mocking laughter echoed through the underground chamber. "But of course," a low, reverberating voice hissed with delight. It seemed to be coming from nowhere and everywhere at once. "Toa Tahu, with a heart of fire and a temper to match. Just how hot can you burn?"</p>
			<p><i>Makuta.</i> Without knowing how he knew, Tahu's mind formed the name.</p>
			<p>This, then, was the Dark One they had sought for so long.</p>
			<p>There was a glimmer of movement in one of the tunnels leading off from the larger central chamber. Tahu leaped toward it instantly and struck with all his strength. But his fire sword sliced through empty air.</p>
			<p>"Wait!" Pohatu cried, even though it was too late. "Tahu, wait a moment. We don't even know what it is we face yet."</p>
			<p>Once again, laughter filled the chamber. "Ah, and this must be the famous Toa Pohatu, with a mind like a stone," the mysterious voice cooed. "Always ready to wait and watch and ponder-even as Mata Nui crumbles around him."</p>
			<p>"It is easy enough to mock us from the shadows," Onua said evenly, stepping into the center of the chamber. "But your words will never defeat us."</p>
			<p>"No doubt," the voice responded silkily. "But it matters not, as I have only to sit back and watch as you defeat yourselves."</p>
			<p>Confused, Gali waited to hear more. But the voice had faded away, as if it had never been.</p>
			<p>"What was that supposed to mean?" Lewa asked, breaking the silence.</p>
			<p>Before Gali could answer, she caught a flash of movement out of the corner of here eye. Spinning to face it, she saw a dark figure racing toward Tahu, wielding a deadly-looking sword.</p>
			<h2>15. Toa VS Toa</h2>
			<p>"Tahu! Look out!"</p>
			<p>The Fire Toa turned just in time to raise his sword against the onslaught. The face of his attacker was hidden behind a blackened, pitted mask, and black smoke billowed from its sword.</p>
			<p>Tahu held the stranger off as best he could. He channeled the power of his flame through his fire sword, pointing it toward the sandy ground beneath his attacker. It instantly crystallized into glass and broke under the stranger's weight. The attacker plummeted out of sight.</p>
			<p>But Tahu barely had time enough to smile before the stranger leaped out of the pit. "Hate to shatter your illusions," it said in a sizzling, crackling voice, "but it will take more than that to get rid of me."</p>
			<p>The words only drove Tahu to greater fury. He shot white-hot flames out of the sword, but his movements were too fast, careless, striking the walls and boulders of the cavern until sparks flew in all directions, showering over the other Toa.</p>
			<p>"Take care, Tahu," the attacker spoke again, "lest the fire of your anger blaze out of control."</p>
			<p>Tahu gritted his teeth. "We'll see how you like my fire now," he said.</p>
			<p>He pointed his sword at the stony cavern floor. Fire poured from the end, melting the rock into steaming, glowing lava.</p>
			<p>"Brother Tahu!" Onua's voice sounded distant, almost lost in the bubbling sound of the boiling lava. "Watch what you're doing-you'll endanger us all!"</p>
			<p>Tahu's mysterious opponent leaped off its rock and surfed across the bubbling lava. Its smile broadened. "Come, give in to the flame," it whispered. "Let it consume you and all you hold dear-I know you can feel it burning deep inside."</p>
			<p>Tahu gasped, startled out of his own anger. What sort of enemy was this? He looked around for help and saw that five more attackers had suddenly appeared, as if out of the shadows themselves, each moving in on a different Toa...</p>
			<p>Nearby, Gali struggled against another mysterious attacker. The stranger's form mirrored her own, but rather than the clean blue of the open sea, its body was the muted, sickly brownish-black of an oil slick.</p>
			<p>"Who are you?" Gali gasped as she released a raging flood of water toward her attacker.</p>
			<p>A chuckle poured out of the attacker, who seemed unaffected by the flood. "Who am I?" it said. "Is the wise, all-seeing Gali really so blind? I am-<i>you</i>!"</p>
			<p>Pohatu jumped atop an enormous boulder just in time to avoid being swept away by Gali's flood. "Hey!" he cried, his usual good nature overwhelmed by near panic. "Gali, take care not to fight your friends as well as your enemy!"</p>
			<p>His opponent smirked. "So much for teamwork," it said in its gravelly voice. "This is how your friends repay your loyalty. Makes one wonder why one should bother with friends at all, doesn't it?"</p>
			<p>"Not at all." Pohatu leaped to the ground and immediately swung his weapon at the bouder. It shattered into hundreds of flying shards, ricocheting off the walls toward the mysterious attacker.</p>
			<p>The stranger laughed as he dodged the rocks. "Too bad, Pohat," it taunted. "Good thing you expect nothing in return for your loyalty to your friends. Because now that the chips are down, it seems they've left you to fight me all alone."</p>
			<p>It was getting hard for Lewa to concentrate on his own battle. First he'd nearly backflipped into the pool of lava that had suddenly appeared to cover half the cave. Then a flood of water had washed through.</p>
			<p>"<i>AI-AI-AI-AI-AI!</i>" he yodeled, flipping himself up and over his attacker's weapons and out of the boulder's path.</p>
			<p><i>CRRRRAAAAAACK!</i></p>
			<p>The cavern shuddered as the boulder struck the wall. Lewa glanced hopefully back toward it, wondering if his opponent might be trapped behind it.</p>
			<p>"Looking for me, Toa of Air?"</p>
			<p><i>What is this creature, this quickdodging darkstranger?</i> Lewa wondered as he leaped into the air to escape another blow. <i>It looks like me-but not like me.</i></p>
			<p>He took in the stranger's pitted mask, blackened as if by a creeping forest mold. Its skin beneath was green-the washed-out green of a diseased leaf.</p>
			<p>Tumbling out of range and lifting his arms, Lewa focused his energies on the air all around him. Soon a whirlwind roared through the cavern. It swept up Lewa's enemy, and the Toa of Air laughed with delight.</p>
			<p>But his opponent merely laughed in return as it glided easily through the currents and soon landed back beside the startled Toa.</p>
			<p>	*	*	*</p>
			<p>It hadn't taken Kopaka long to realize what was happening-Makuta had created these shadowy versions of the Toa to challenge them where the Manas and all his other creatures had failed.</p>
			<p>And so far, the plan seemed to be working.</p>
			<p>Kopaka fought on grimly. Neither he nor his enemy was wasting any energy on words. Kopaka found his frustration rising as each of his carefully executed moves was met and returned with equal precision.</p>
			<p><i>This isn't working,</i> he thought. <i>There has to be a better way...</i></p>
			<p>"This should cool you off," he muttered.</p>
			<p>He touched his ice sword to the ground and focused his energy. Instantaneously, the cavern floor froze into a solid sheet of ice.</p>
			<p>Even as he did it, Kopaka realized he'd miscalculated. His enemy smiled as it glided across the ice, its moves more graceful and controlled than ever.</p>
			<p>"I see you've just recognized the cold, hard truth," it whispered in a voice as sharp as an icicle.</p>
			<p>	*	*	*</p>
			<p>Onua shook his head, willing himself to focus, to think through this problem. He had already tried overpowering his enemy with raw strength, but its might matched his own. He had attempted to trap it by tunneling through the cavern wall and then collapsing the tunnel atop it, but the creature had burrowed out easily.</p>
			<p><i>We can't go on this way,</i> he thought desperately.</p>
			<p>Right now the Toa were at an impasse, evenly matched with their enemy. But if even one of them went down, it could mean the end of all of them.</p>
			<p>Feeling uncharacteristically desperate, the Earth Toa struck the ground before him with all his might. The earth rumbled at the blow, shaking the entire cavern and sending a hailstorm of rocks and earth raining down on all the fighters.</p>
			<p>Onua felt despair grip him as he saw that while the other Toa had been knocked off their feet, his own opponent merely leaped over the torn earth and moved in to press the attack.</p>
			<h2>16. Unity, Duty, Destiny</h2>
			<p>Kopaka hit the ground hard as the quake rumbled beneath him. His enemy was on him in a flash.</p>
			<p>He managed to block the blow with his shield and then swing his ice blade upward. If he could just aim...</p>
			<p><i>SKREEEEEEEK!</i></p>
			<p>Kopaka smiled as he saw that his enemy was frozen in place. Kopaka sent the frozen enemy skittering across the ice until it smashed into the cavern wall. The creature shattered into hundreds of icy shards.</p>
			<p>And each of the ice shards was forming into a new enemy!</p>
			<p>Nearby, Onua glanced over and gasped when he saw Kopaka's predicament.</p>
			<p><i>This is bad,</i> Onua thought helplessly, dodging another blow from his own enemy. <i>How can I fight one so much like myself? How can any of us?</i></p>
			<p>He blinked as the answer dawned on him at last. Of course!</p>
			<p>"Listen up!" he shouted. "We're going about this all wrong. We can't hope to defeat our own shadow doubles-but that's why we're a team!" He wanted to say more, but he didn't have the chace-he had to dive aside to avoid another blow from his opponent's weapon.</p>
			<p>Pohatu heard Onua's words, but he couldn't respond for a moment. He was too busy fending off his own attacker. But in the back of his mind, he turned over the Earth Toa's plan and found that it made sense.</p>
			<p>"Who are you kidding?" his opponent chortled mirthlessly, as if reading his thoughts. "They're not going to fight <i>for</i> you, Toa of Stone, or even <i>with</i> you. They'll use your strength to save themselves, then leave you behind."</p>
			<p>"No," Pohatu said firmly, putting all his strength into one leg as he shattered another boulder with a mighty kick. His enemy fell back to avoid the shrapnel of stone, but instead of pressing the advantage, Pohatu spun away and glanced quickly around the cavern.</p>
			<p>He saw the Fire Toa desperately trying to fend off a volley of blows with his fire sword. "Tahu!" Pohatu shouted. "Stand back!"</p>
			<p>Gathering his energy, he leaped upward and struck the ceiling of the cave with a mighty blow of his fist. As the pieces broke off and fell, Pohatu directed them straight onto the Fire Toa's opponent.</p>
			<p>"Aaaaaaaah!" the smoky stranger cried, raising its arms to protect itself. Flames shot out of its sword, but it was no use. It couldn't melt the falling stones fast enough. Within seconds it was buried beneath a mound of rocky debris.</p>
			<p>Tahu stared at Pohatu in surprise. "What did you do that for? I was just about to-"</p>
			<p>"Never mind," Pohatu yelped, turning to defend himself against his opponent. "Help Gali!"</p>
			<p>Tahu glanced over his shoulder and saw that the Water Toa was on the ground at the edge of the lava pool, her enemy advancing upon her.</p>
			<p>"Gali!" Tahu cried. "Hold on, I'm coming!"</p>
			<p>"Tahu!" Gali gasped. "Don't-this thing is too strong!"</p>
			<p>But Tahu didn't hesitate. As the Shadow Gali whirled to face him, he pointed his fire sword. Heat and flame danced out from the end, wrapping around the enemy as it howled in surprise.</p>
			<p>Steam hissed out in all directions, obscuring his view. When it faded, nothing remained of the Shadow Gali but a puddle on the cavern floor.</p>
			<p>The defeat of two of the shadow enemies gave the other Toa new strength of purpose. Gali re-formed her flood and sent it gurgling toward the Shadow Onua. It cried out in dismay as water pounded against int, eroding it away into nothing but a bit of sand.</p>
			<p>The distraction gave Onua the chance to help Lewa. Seeing that the Air Toa's enemy was somersaulting high in the air out of reach, Onua quickly summoned the earth beneath his feet to rise up, trapping the high-flying enemy in a floor-to-ceiling column of dirt and stone.</p>
			<p>Freed from his enemy, Lewa saw that Kopaka and Pohatu alone remained under attack.</p>
			<p>While Pohatu was holding his own, the ice-shard enemies had Kopaka surrounded.</p>
			<p>"I'm coming!" Lewa shouted, tumbling through the air around the icy battle. "Kopaka!" he cried. "DUCK!"</p>
			<p>The Ice Toa looked startled, but threw himself to the floor. A split second later, the whirlwind roared down around him, grabbing the shard soldiers into its grasp and spinning them around and around at dizzying speed.</p>
			<p>The icy shard-soldiers crashed against one another again and again. Before long they had disintegrated into tiny sparkles of ice.</p>
			<p>"Bad move," Kopaka said bleakly. "What if they all form into enemies again?"</p>
			<p>"Not a problem," Tahu said, blasting the ice crystals with his fire sword. Within seconds, they had melted and evaporated into steam.</p>
			<p>"Guys?" Pohatu called breathlessly. "Um, hey-anyone want to give me a hand here?"</p>
			<p>The Toa of Stone was still trading blows with his shadow self. "Oops!" Lewa said.</p>
			<p>"I'll take care of this," Kopaka said. "Stand back."</p>
			<p>Taking a deep breath, the Ice Toa blew out a frosty blast, freezing the area around Pohatu into a sheet of ice. The Shadow Pohatu skidded across, winding up in Tahu's pool of lava, where it sank with a gurgle.</p>
			<p><i>Drip. Drip. Drip.</i></p>
			<p>Once again, the cave was nearly silent. The Toa stood there for a long moment, staring at one another. Then, as a group, they collapsed wearily to the ground.</p>
			<p>After catching his breath, Tahu sat up and glanced at Onua, who was watching the others thougthfully. "What do you think, brother?" he asked the Earth Toa.</p>
			<p>Onua smiled, though there was a hint of wariness in his eyes. "I think," he said, "that we have won an important battle, and of that we can be proud. But there is more to come."</p>
			<p>Tahu nodded, his grin fading as he gripped his fire sword more tightly. Yes, Onua was right. He could feel it, burning in his mind like a half-remembered dream.</p>
			<p>There was much more to come.</p>

			<h1>BIONICLE Chronicles #2: Beware the Bohrok</h1>
			<h3>C. A. Hapka</h3>
			<h2>1. Underground</h2>
			<p><i>Clean it all...it must be cleaned.</i></p>
			<p>The creature stirred and opened its eyes.</p>
			<p><i>Clean it all...clean it all...</i></p>
			<p>It felt confusion. It wanted, needed to move. To clean.</p>
			<p><i>It must be cleaned it must be cleaned it must be cleaned...</i></p>
			<p>The creature pushed against the hard, silent objects surrounding it in the darkness. One of the objects shifted.</p>
			<p><i>Clean it all,</i> the second being's mind offered sleepily.</p>
			<p><i>It must be cleaned,</i> the first agreed, strangely relieved. <i>It must be cleaned.</i></p>
			<p><i>All obstacles will be removed.</i></p>
			<p><i>It must be cleaned. It will be cleaned.</i></p>
			<p>The first creature's panic faded. It was not time yet. The time would come-soon. But not yet.</p>
			<p>It relaxed and fell silent again. All was dark and still.</p>
			<p>For now.</p>
			<h2>2. The Calm Before The Storm</h2>
			<p>The Toa couldn't contain their joy. Finally! Out of the darkness of the tunnels, safe from Makuta and his minions, free to enjoy the sunlight and the beauty of the island. Except...</p>
			<p>"I wonder what Makuta has in store for us next," Gali, Toa of Water, said, and a shadow settled over the group.</p>
			<p>Tahu, Toa of Fire, nodded. None of them knew much about the dark being known as Makuta. The six Toa had arrived on Mata Nui remembering nothing but their names and a few snippets of confusing and frightening dreams. But they soon learned of their duty-to protect the island and its people from the powers of darkness.</p>
			<p>The Fire Toa touched his mask, feeling the energy humming beneath its golden surface. Each Toa wore a golden Kanohi mask just like his. The masks' awesome powers had just helped the Toa defeat the fearsome Rahi.</p>
			<p>"I bet Makuta is deephiding now that he's seen our fightpower," Lewa, Toa of Air, said, puffing out his green chest proudly. "He won't soon fearchallenge Mata Nui again."</p>
			<p>"Such bragging seems unwise and unnecessary," said Kopaka, Toa of Ice, in a cold voice.</p>
			<p>Onua, Toa of Earth, was about to agree-in a gentler way-when he sensed the ground tremble beneath him. "Quiet," he ordered abruptly, raising a hand to the other Toa.</p>
			<p>Tahu, Lewa, and Gali paused and glanced at him. "What is it?" Lewa asked eagerly. "Do you feel something? Hear something? Is it Mata Nui awakening, do you think?" The Toa had never forgotten their ultimate goal: to awaken the spirit of Mata Nui. Now that Makuta's Rahi had been vanquished, there seemed to be nothing standing in their way.</p>
			<p>"I don't know." Onua frowned, focusing his mind on the earth below him. Now it came again-a shudder, as if the entire island were shifting in its sleep. Was it Mata Nui emerging?</p>
			<p>The next tremble was stronger. "Whoa!" Gali shouted. "Brothers, if this <i>is</i> Mata Nui, I fear he's in a very bad mood!"</p>
			<p>The earth shuddered again, with a grinding of stone against stone and the creak and roar of falling trees and tumbling rocks. Onua braced himself against a nearby swell and closed his eyes as yet another spasm shook the land. Could this be Mata Nui? Or had they awakened someone-or something-else?</p>
			<h2>3. The Awakening</h2>
			<p>The creature, deep in slumber, felt the trembling of the earth.</p>
			<p>It awoke. This time, there was no mistake.</p>
			<p><i>It is time.</i></p>
			<p>As the thunderous vibrations rocked the cave, another creature stirred, and another. Dozens upon hundreds upon thousands.</p>
			<p>They shook off their long, deep sleep. Energy poured through them, along with absolute knowledge. Their duty waited. It was time.</p>
			<p><i>It must be cleaned. It is time. Clean it all.</i></p>
			<p><i>It is time. All obstacles will be removed.</i></p>
			<p><i>Clean it all. It must be cleaned.</i></p>
			<p><i>It is time.</i></p>
			<p>	*	*	*</p>
			<p>"Look!" Pohatu, Toa of Stone, shouted, pointing at a figure revealed by the falling trees. "It's one of Tahu's villagers!"</p>
			<p>Tahu leaped forward, surprised to find anyone from his fiery village of Ta-Koro so far from home. The Matoran was lying on the ground, his legs trapped by a fallen tree branch. He seemed stunned, and was muttering one word over and over.</p>
			<p>Quickly freeing the villager, Tahu leaned closer, trying to hear him. "Speak," he said. "What brings you so far from Ta-Koro?"</p>
			<p>The villager was still babbling, not making any sense.</p>
			<p>"What's he saying?" Gali asked.</p>
			<p>The Matoran seemed unaware of the Toa's presence. He stared blindly ahead, his eyes cloudy with terror.</p>
			<p>"<i>Bohrokbohrokbohrokbohrok</i>," he muttered tonelessly.</p>
			<p>"What?" Pohatu stepped closer, looking confused. "What is it? What's he saying?"</p>
			<p>"Little brother!" Lewa said loudly, touching the Matoran on the shoulder. "What is it? What's wrong? We're here to help you."</p>
			<p>The Matoran didn't react. He hardly seemed to pause for breath as he babbled on in the same rapid, frightened voice. "<i>Bohrokbohrokbohrokbohrok</i>..."</p>
			<p>"What's he saying?" Pohatu repeated.</p>
			<p>"One word, over and over," Tahu reported. "<i>Bohrok</i>. I must return to Ta-Koro immediately."</p>
			<p>"We'll go, Tahu," Gali spoke up.</p>
			<p>Onua nodded. "If there is a threat to your village, it is a threat to all our people."</p>
			<p>Tahu accepted with a quick bow of his head. Then, slinging the Matoran over his shoulder, he gestured for the others to follow.</p>
			<p>He raced through the trees and meadows toward the foothills of the Mangai. The others were close behind him.</p>
			<p>"I have just one question," Pohatu said after a few minutes. The Toa had quickly crossed the flatlands and foothills and were now climbing steadily toward the village perched near the topmost slopes of the mountain.</p>
			<p>"What's that?" Gail asked.</p>
			<p>"What's a Bohrok?" Pohatu wondered.</p>
			<p>Tahu, who was still in the lead, skidded to a halt. He stood on a ledge overlooking the village of Ta-Koro.</p>
			<p>"I fear we have just found out."</p>
			<h2> 4. The Arrival</h2>
			<p>The Toa gaped in amazement at the sight before them. In the distance, Ta-Koro rose against the rocky slope of the mountain, its stone gates and magma buildings unharmed. But the plain before it was in ruins.</p>
			<p>Thick black smoke poured from piles of rubble and gouges in the earth. Trees and plants had been ripped out by the roots and tossed about like toys. Near the gates, frightened villagers milled around, shouting and crying with panic.</p>
			<p>"What could have caused this?" Lewa whispered to Gali worriedly.</p>
			<p>Gali pointed. "Them. Look!"</p>
			<p>Dozens of strange creatures were moving across the plain-large two-legged armored beasts with powerful-looking claws. Some were silvery-white and some bronze, and a few were much smaller than the others, but all scuttled about like enormous insects. As Lewa watched, several of the bronze beasts gathered together, then stormed straight into a small hill, leveling it to the ground.</p>
			<p>Tahu set the still-stunned Matoran on the ground. "Stay here," he said firmly, hoping the villager understood. "We'll deal with this!"</p>
			<p>The others were already rushing forward to stop the strange creatures. Lewa reached one of the bronze-colored ones just as it headed toward a small clump of trees. "Let's see how these things stand up to a cyclone!"</p>
			<p>He leaped into the air in front of the creature and breathed in, preparing to summon the winds to his aid. But before so much as a breeze had stirred, the creature moved forward, letting out an unearthly screech.</p>
			<p>Lewa reeled as an icy blast of cold air struck him. "What? Ice?" he cried, struggling to remain in the air. But it was no use. He was frozen in a block of ice, unable to move or even levitate. He crashed to the ground with a thud.</p>
			<p>"Away from him, creatures!" Tahu cried, leaping forward and dragging Lewa out of harm's way.</p>
			<p>Lewa shook off the ice, which melted quickly near Tahu's sword. He jumped to his feet, ready to face the creature again.</p>
			<p>But the creature showed no interest in him. Instead it uprooted a tree and then moved on toward a large lava hill.</p>
			<p>"This is crazy," Onua called from somewhere nearby. "They aren't harming the villagers; they ignore us unless we get right in their way! So why all this chaos?"</p>
			<p>"I don't know," Pohatu said. "But we have to stop them!"</p>
			<p>Everywhere Lewa looked he saw more of the strange creatures. "But how?" he exclaimed. "There are so many of them!"</p>
			<p>Tahu knew they had to do something fast if there was any hope of saving his village. Suddenly he had an idea.</p>
			<p>"Lewa!" he cried. "Gali! Combine your powers!"</p>
			<p>Raising their arms, Lewa and Gali summoned the winds and the rain. Soon a mighty storm raged above the peak.</p>
			<p><i>KA-BOOOOOOM!</i></p>
			<p>An enormous blast of lightning rocked the valley in front of the village. The destructive beasts were tossed high into the air, sparking and shrieking. As they landed, they scuttled for shelter. Soon all had disappeared.</p>
			<p>All but one. It lay damaged and stunned, legs waving weakly in the air.</p>
			<p>"They're gone for now," Pohatu commented, bending over the injured creature. "They left us a prisoner, too. But what's in its head?"</p>
			<p>The others gathered around for a better look at their new enemy. The sloping shield that covered its head had been thrown back by the impact. A glowing, green object lay inside.</p>
			<p>Before they could figure out what it might be, a voice spoke from behind them. "I know the answers you seek, though I wish I did not."</p>
			<p>It was the leader of the villagers of Ta-Koro. "Turaga Vakama!" Pohatu said. "What is it? What are these creatures?"</p>
			<p>The Turaga sighed. "We have known the legends of the Bohrok for centuries, and we prayed they were only legends. But the Bohrok are real-all too real. And they are swarming over all of Mata Nui."</p>
			<p>"Tell us more," Tahu ordered, stepping forward to face his village's Turaga. "We need to know what we face."</p>
			<p>Vakama nodded. "It is said the Bohrok sleep an eternal sleep, waiting to hatch. Once awakened, the swarms are unstoppable-a force so powerful, they can reduce mountains to rubble and turn rivers dry as the desert sands. These creatures do not work alone."</p>
			<p>"Right," Pohatu said. "They have those smaller creatures with them-like little scouts or something."</p>
			<p>"Those are the Bohrok Va," Vakama said. "And you are right-they are smaller, quicker creatures that act as scouts and couriers. But that's not what I meant. You see, each Bohrok carries within it a krana."</p>
			<p>"That?" Kopaka asked, pointing to the glowing object inside the disabled Bohrok. "Is that the krana?"</p>
			<p>"It looks like a mask," Pohatu observed.</p>
			<p>"Yes," Vakama said. "It gives them purpose and power. Their krana are their greatest strength-but also their greatest weakness. Even the mightiest of Bohrok can be humbled if parted from its krana."</p>
			<p>"These krana," Tahu said. "Do they come from Makuta?"</p>
			<p>Vakama shook his head. "That we do not know," he said. "The legends do not offer an answer."</p>
			<p>The Toa listened carefully as the Turaga outlined the different swarms of Bohrok. Those like the one that had blasted him with its icy breath were known as Kohrak. The bronze-colored ones were the Pahrak, which could turn mountains to crumbling stone. The stealthy Gahlok hid beneath the waves and struck when least expected. The fiery Tahnok were capable of melting through any substance, while the powerful Nuhvok lurked below the surface and dug mazes of tunnels to weaken the structures that stood above. Most feared of all were the Lehvak, whose acid venom could dissolve even solid rock.</p>
			<p>"All right," Lewa said when the Turaga paused for breath. "Enough of the feartalking. What do we do to defeat these Bohrok?"</p>
			<p>"Now that the swarms have awakened, only one hope remains," Vakama said. "You must collect the eight breeds of krana from each Bohrok swarm. They will unlock the secret to the Bohrok's defeat."</p>
			<p>"Eight breeds of krana?" Gali asked. "What do you mean?"</p>
			<p>"Like the Bohrok themselves, the krana serve different purposes," Vakama explained. "Each type looks slightly different. The one you see there is one of the Krana Xa, the swarm commander." He pointed to the disabled Bohrok again. "You must gather one of each type of krana from each of the six swarms."</p>
			<p>"But why?" Pohatu asked. "What will that tell us?"</p>
			<p>"The knowing will come," Vakama replied. "That is all that has been foretold."</p>
			<p>Tahu grimaced. <i>The knowing will come.</i> The Toa had been hearing that phrase since arriving on the island.</p>
			<p>He grabbed the krana inside the fallen Bohrok. It was warm and squishy, slightly heavier than it looked. He stared at it, wondering how something so small could cause so much damage and devastation. "Return to your villages," he told the others. "If gathering these krana will save Mata Nui, then that's what we'll do."</p>
			<p>"What do you mean?" Gali said. "We can't split up now-not when a new danger threatens Mata Nui. Didn't we learn anything from the fight against the Rahi? We are much more powerful when we're all together. Unity-"</p>
			<p>"-Duty, destiny," Tahu said impatiently, finishing the common Matoran saying. "Yes, I know. But if these things are all over Mata Nui, we need to meet them wherever they are."</p>
			<p>"Tahu is right," Kopaka said. "My village needs me. I must go there."</p>
			<p>Gali was so surprised to hear Kopaka agreeing with Tahu that she couldn't speak for a moment. "All right," she said at last. "Perhaps we should see to our own villages. But be careful. And let's plan to meet again soon."</p>
			<p>As the others nodded, Vakama held up his hand. "A warning before you go, brave Toa," he said urgently. "Beware the krana! When worn, they can steal the mind-and even the Toa might not be able to resist such terrible power."</p>
			<h2>5. Mountains Crumble</h2>
			<p>Pohatu was the first of the Toa to reach his own village. Po-Koro was located in the barren, rocky desert. The Po-Matoran had built sturdy dwellings of rock and sand that blended in with the desert's craggy peaks and blowing dunes.</p>
			<p>As he drew near Po-Koro, Pohatu realized that the land before him looked much different than the last time he'd come this way.</p>
			<p>"Bohrok," he muttered grimly. The village was in danger-even from this distance, he could see the Bohrok swarms moving along the Path of Prophecies, closer and closer to the gates of Po-Koro.</p>
			<p>Pohatu raced forward. "So we're playing host to the Pahrak, eh?" he murmured. "Well, I'm not feeling very welcoming right now."</p>
			<p>He leaped over a fallen monument and looked around. Turaga Onewa was struggling against a Pahrak, trying to keep it from knocking over another monument. But the insectlike creature hardly seemed to notice the blows. It pushed past the Turaga and crashed against the tall carved stone.</p>
			<p>"Stand aside, Onewa!" Pohatu cried, racing toward the Pahrak.</p>
			<p>"Pohatu!" Onewa exclaimed with relief. "It is good to see you. Especially now."</p>
			<p>Pohatu flashed a rueful grin. "It's good to feel so loved, my friend," he quipped. "Quick now-the monuments are already lost. We need to focus on protecting the village itself."</p>
			<p>Onewa nodded. "I will alert the others. We will protect the village gates-whatever it takes." With that, he hurried off.</p>
			<p>The Toa turned back to the Pahrak. They were everywhere-too many to count</p>
			<p>"Gather the krana," he reminded himself in a murmur. "That's the key. We need those krana."</p>
			<p>Pohatu leaped onto the back of a nearby Pahrak. He held on tightly as the Pahrak bucked and leaped, trying to dislodge him. Its moves were slow and easy to manage-until it marched toward one of the monuments, an intricately carved arching stone. The Pahrak ducked beneath, scraping the Toa off on the overhanging stone.</p>
			<p>"Oof!" Pohatu cried as he hit the ground. "All right, so you want to play dirty, eh, Pahrak?"</p>
			<p>The Pahrak took no notice of the Toa or his words. It was already trying to topple another monument. Dusting himself off, Pohatu raced past the creature. He stood on the other side of the Rahi Stone and leaned against it. The great stone trembled against his hands as the Pahrak on the other side shoved at it.</p>
			<p>Taking a deep breath, the Toa of Stone stepped back and then leaped forward, aiming a powerful kick at the center of the stone. The great monument toppled forward immediately and there was a shriek of surprise from the other side.</p>
			<p><i>CRAAAASSSSSSSH-KRUK!</i></p>
			<p>The enormous stone crashed to the ground-with the Pahrak trapped underneath.</p>
			<p>"Sorry, my ugly friend," Pohatu said, stepping forward and wrenching the headplate off the creature. "I'm afraid you have something I need." He carefully lifted the glowing green krana from within. He was pleased to see that it was slightly different in shape from the one they'd found back in Ta-Koro. Good-that was one more toward the set of Pahrak krana they needed.</p>
			<p>He tucked it into his belt and leaped back into action, heading for the next Pahrak.</p>
			<p>Pohatu wasn't sure how much time had passed when he heard a shout from above.</p>
			<p>"More are coming!"</p>
			<p>He glanced up and saw that the shout had come from the lookout post atop the village gates, where a villager was scanning the horizon.</p>
			<p>The Toa of Stone hooked his climbing claws into the gate and swung himself up to the lookout. Another swarm of Bohrok was heading toward the village. They were Lehvak, judging by their bright green color and the way they melted everything in their path by shooting acid yout of their curved claws.</p>
			<p>"What should we do?" the Matoran asked.</p>
			<p>Pohatu's heart sank. Though he had been successful in gaining a few more krana, he'd been unable to drive off the Pahrak swarms. And now there would be more...</p>
			<p>But his voice was steady as he replied, "What else can we do, little brother, but let them come, and fight them when they get here?"</p>
			<p>Then he leaped down to meet the Lehvak, ready to defend his village and his people.</p>
			<h2>6. Earth Trembles</h2>
			<p>Onua was walking through a tunnel that led toward the village of Onu-Koro.</p>
			<p><i>These Bohrok will stop at nothing until Mata Nui has been completely leveled,</i> he mused. <i>But why?</i></p>
			<p>He paused, hearing a faint sound from somewhere off to the left.</p>
			<p><i>CHINNGCH! CHINNGCH! CHINNGCH!</i></p>
			<p>Onua frowned. That didn't sound like any digging or mining tool he knew.</p>
			<p>"Bohrok," he murmured. "I wonder where you are? Let's see if we can find a shortcut."</p>
			<p>He listened for another second or two, and then struck with his fists. He broke through the tunnel wall, burrowing straight through the solid earth. He burst through a moment later into a cavern that lay just a few hundred yards from the arched stone gates of Onu-Koro.</p>
			<p>The place was crawling with the dark, smooth shapes of Bohrok. As Onua watched, a pair of the creatures drilled a series of short tunnels into the wall on the far side of the cave. The wall shuddered and shifted.</p>
			<p>"Hey!" Onua cried. But it was too late. The wall and the ceiling above crumbled and fell in on itself, raining debris onto the ground. The Bohrok moved on to another spot a few yards away. The rest of the swarm were drilling in other spots along the wall-if Onua didn't stop them, they would bring down the entire cavern.</p>
			<p>Nuhvok. That was what the Turaga had called them-swarms of Bohrok that tunneled deep underground, destroying the island from the inside out.</p>
			<p>He leaped forward, grabbing the nearest Bohrok. It let out a hiss of annoyance and tossed him away.</p>
			<p>Surprised at the creature's strength, Onua resumed his attack. "Don't think you can get away with that."</p>
			<p>This time he grabbed the creature by one of its legs, flipping it head over heels. The Nuhvok's headplate struck a rock and flipped open.</p>
			<p>"That's more like it," Onua said, grabbing the glowing green krana inside and peeling it free.</p>
			<p>He left the Nuhvok and moved on, glancing at the krana he held as he did. Its shape was slightly different from the one Tahu had removed outside Ta-Koro.</p>
			<p>Over the next few minutes, he managed to gather several more krana. It wasn't an easy task-the Bohrok were strong, and whenever one came to another's aid Onua quickly found himself overpowered. Several times, only the Nuhvok's slow reactions saved the Toa from disaster.</p>
			<p>"This is taking too long," he said. As long as there were so many of them, so totally focused on destruction that they couldn't be distracted...</p>
			<p>Onua suddenly stood up straight. He had an idea-a way he might be able to use the Bohrok's own focus against them. Glancing out of his tunnel, he noted that the Nuhvok were methodically taking down the dozen or so stone columns that helped support the cavern's roof. They seemed determined to destroy each column and collapse the entire cavern.</p>
			<p>Dodging the slow-moving creatures, which ignored him as usual, Onua raced to the center of the room, where a cluster of columns still stood.</p>
			<p><i>I just need a few seconds...</i></p>
			<p>He quickly dug a trench in the floor, a skinny moat surrounding the group of columns.</p>
			<p>Then he waited.</p>
			<p>It wasn't long before several Nuhvok turned their attention toward the remaining columns. One moved toward them, pausing on the lip of the trench in apparent confusion.</p>
			<p>Onua leaped forward and gave the creature a shove. It let out a shriek of dismay as it toppled over, skidding straight into the trench.</p>
			<p>"Now, let's just see if I calculated the width correctly," Onua murmured.</p>
			<p>The Nuhvok fell about halfway to the bottom of the trench before the narrow walls stopped it. The creature struggled, its limbs waving helplessly. But it did no good. It was stuck between the walls of the trench!</p>
			<p>"This is almost too easy," Onua said, stepping forward and yanking back the Nuhvok's headplate. He jumped back as the creature's clawed arm swung toward him, nearly connecting with his head. "Hey, I said <i>almost,</i>" he added, ducking back in just long enough to grab the Nuhvok's krana.</p>
			<p>Luckily the Nuhvok seemed to have more determination than brains. Several more fell for the same trick, and before long Onua had a full set of krana.</p>
			<p>"There," he said. "That wasn't so-"</p>
			<p><i>CHIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIYIYIYI!</i></p>
			<p>A sudden scream echoed through the cavern. Onua spun around and saw a small Nuhvok Va careening toward him. He leaped aside, preparing to fight off its attack.</p>
			<p>But the creature ignored him. It stopped in the middle of the cavern, still emitting its high-pitched screech. All the Nuhvok stopped what they were doing immediately and turned to face the Nuhvok Va. Then, as if with one mind, they all scattered in different directions. Within seconds, the cavern was empty except for Onua.</p>
			<p>The Earth Toa stared after them in surprise. What had made them run away like that?</p>
			<p>He hurried on until he reached the outskirts of Onu-Koro and gazed across the tunnel that encircled the village. The caverns he could see on the other side looked normal, and Onua let out a breath of relief, glad that his village had escaped the swarms.</p>
			<p>"Whenua!" Onua shouted, calling for the Turaga as he raced into a spacious cavern. "Whenua, where are you?"</p>
			<p>The Turaga appeared almost immediately. "Toa Onua!" he called out with a bow. "It is good to see you. The people are worried-we've heard terrible rumors-"</p>
			<p>"What you've heard is most likely true. The Bohrok swarms have emerged, and they are on the move. I'm glad to see that Onu-Koro has so far been spared. And I intend to keep it that way if I can. I've just chased off a swarm of Nuhvok."</p>
			<p>"If anyone can protect us, Toa Onua, it's you. Young Nuparu just left for the surface to see whether-"</p>
			<p>"Shh." Onua hushed him in midsentence. What was that? He'd felt a vibration, a sort of rumbling...</p>
			<p><i>SWOOOOOOOOOOOOSH!</i></p>
			<p>With a blast of sound and fury, a raging tidal wave roared into the cavern from the next tunnel, sweeping away villagers, stones, and earth.</p>
			<p>Onua was blown off his feet by the force of the first wave. It smashed him against the rock dwellings behind him, and he scrabbled for a handhold as he felt the wild current yanking him away again.</p>
			<p><i>Must-hold-on</i>...he thought grimly as his hands slid across a smooth surface. He couldn't see a thing-the water had knocked his mask askew, blocking his vision. But just as he felt his body being swept backward, the Earth Toa's hands found a stone bar. Whatever it was, he gripped it tightly, praying that it was strong enough to withstand the rushing water.</p>
			<p>After several endless seconds, the water receded as the flood thundered on into deeper tunnels. Onua clambered up the cave wall for a better look at the damage. What he saw made his heart sink-the water hadn't had much effect on the basic structures, since they were carved out of the cave wall. But all the decorations and special touches the villagers had added to their dwellings had been swept away or destroyed. Lightposts had been knocked askew, their lightstones scattered. All sorts of debris floated on the water's surface.</p>
			<p>Whenua looked out from the doorway where he'd clung through the flood. "We'd better find out if everyone's all right and get to the surface. It's not safe to be here-if another wave of water comes, it could fill this cavern to the ceiling."</p>
			<p>Onua nodded. "Good plan. On the surface, we can seek out the other Toa and their villagers. The strength of these swarms are in their numbers-we need numbers on our side as well."</p>
			<h2>7. Ambush!</h2>
			<p>Lewa bounded toward Le-Koro, hoping that the Bohrok hadn't reached it yet. His villagers were courageous and capable, but Lewa knew that without him they would be no match for the Bohrok swarms.</p>
			<p>Landing easily in the highest branches of a Madu tree, Lewa peered ahead. Smoke was drifting lazily up into the sky from the vicinity of the village.</p>
			<p>Quickening his pace, the Toa of Air leaped from tree to tree, wondering how to protect the treetop village from attack. <i>Perhaps it's as Tahu often says-the best defense is a good offense,</i> Lewa told himself. <i>I could gather some of the village's best windriders and do a little cloudsneaking to find the enemy before it finds us.</i></p>
			<p>A stray breeze wound its way through the trees as Lewa neared the village. Tipping his face up to feel it, he launched himself through the air, catching the breeze and allowing it to guide him softly to the ground.</p>
			<p>He landed by a gnarled old tree at the edge of a clearing. As he straightened up, he was startled to see that the clearing was filled with Le-Matoran. Turaga Matau was standing at the head of the crowd. He was clutching his Kau Kau staff as usual. But-what was that on his face, in place of his regular mask?</p>
			<p>Lewa gasped in horror. It wasn't just Matau-all of the villagers wore glowing masks over their faces, each pulsing from a sickly green to a hideous orange. Behind the masked Matoran, plumes of acrid smoke traced ugly patterns in the air, blocking the view of the village above.</p>
			<p>Matau smiled as he stepped forward toward the Toa, the expression grotesque behind the pulsing, unfamiliar mask.</p>
			<p>"Greetings, Lewa," the Turaga said in a monotone voice. "We have been waiting for you."</p>
			<h2>8. Danger Beneath the Waves</h2>
			<p>The route to Gali's village took her through Lewa's jungle-covered range. As she entered the moist shade beneath the tree canopy, she paused to listen. SHe heard only the normal sounds of dripping water and rustling wind.</p>
			<p>Still, Gali sensed that something was not right in the jungle.</p>
			<p><i>There are disturbances,</i> she thought uncertainly. <i>Strange pulsations</i>...</p>
			<p>Whatever it was, it was crashing through the underbrush, heading in her direction. A moment later she felt a blast of heat, and a dead tree trunk nearby burst into flames.</p>
			<p>"Tahnok," Gali muttered sourly as more than a dozen red figures burst out of the woods. She paused, watching as one of them breathed a column of flame at a lush Vuata Maca tree. The intense heat scorched parts of the trunk, but the dripping branches didn't catch fire. The Tahnok rammed the tree, but the Vuata Maca's deep roots held against the assault. Other members of the swarm were having similar problems.</p>
			<p>"Not so easy for you here, eh, my Tahnok friends?" Gali said with sly amusement. "This place isn't suited for your brand of mischief."</p>
			<p>The Tahnok Va at the head of the swarm paused, and for a moment Gali thought it meant to turn and attack her. Instead, it stood for a moment with its firestaff held aloft. Then it turned and scampered off toward the northwest.</p>
			<p>"Going to visit Pohatu, are you?" Gali said. "Somehow I don't think he'll appreciate the social call. Maybe I can thin the numbers a little before you get there."</p>
			<p>Grabbing a vine, she swung after the Tahnok. When she landed in front of them, they paused only momentarily before continuing on their way, clearly intending to bulldoze over her.</p>
			<p>But the Water Toa was already gathering her energies, calling upon the elements to answer her. A moment later a rainstorm pelted down on the Tahnok, extinguishing their flame. The creatures gnashed their teeth furiously, darting beneath the trees for shelter. Soon the already swampy ground was puddled and soft.</p>
			<p>The Tahnok at the head of the swarm scurried forward onto a particularly marshy spot. Gali held her breath, waiting to see if her plan would work. As the Tahnok took another step, she smiled as it began to sink, its powerful legs trapped by the sucking, wet soil.</p>
			<p>The creature shrieked in annoyance, struggling to pull its leg free. As it did so, another leg got caught in the mire. Soon it was trapped, unable to move forward or backward. Every time it tried, it only sank deeper.</p>
			<p>Now it would be easy for Gali to retrieve its krana. She wrapped a sturdy jungle vine around the Tahnok and lifted its headplate.</p>
			<p>Soon she was holding the krana in her hand. It felt warm and alive, unlike the Tahnok itself, which had stopped struggling as soon as the Toa grabbed its krana.</p>
			<p>"I see," she murmured thoughtfully, staring at the Tahnok. "The Bohrok themselves do not really live-they are merely vehicles for the true life force of the krana."</p>
			<p>Gali wasted no more time. She raced for the coastline, anxious to see what was happening in her village. She resolved that once she had made sure her villagers were safe, she would return to the other Toa. Perhaps together they could figure out a way to stop the Bohrok invasion-before there was nothing left to protect.</p>
			<h2>9. Lost</h2>
			<p>Lewa tripped over a Bula root, almost falling to the ground. He growled in anger. Clutter. It was all clutter-these roots, these trees, the leaves and branches and stems and trunks. The water and the rocks. The soil, the sucking, spongy earth beneath everything else. All of it. It all had to go.</p>
			<p><i>Clean it.</i> The words echoed in his head, clear and strong and right. <i>Clean it all. It must be cleaned.</i></p>
			<p>"It must be cleaned," Lewa muttered.</p>
			<p>He blinked, confused by the sound of his own voice. What had he just said? <i>It must be cleaned.</i> What did that mean? It didn't make sense.</p>
			<p><i>It's a-a quest of some kind,</i> he thought slowly. <i>A duty. But I thought-I thought I already had a quest. A duty. Something I was supposed to-supposed to-</i></p>
			<p>As his thoughts trailed off into bewilderment, he was startled to notice that he now held the tree root-the one that had tripped him-in his hands. How had that happened? He glanced down and saw the gouge in the earth where the root had been ripped free.</p>
			<p><i>Did I do that?</i> he wondered uncertainly. <i>Why?</i></p>
			<p>Before he could come up with an answer, he found himself raising his arms. A moment later, a howling gale was whirling around him. The wind tore the Bula tree straight out of the ground and tossed it aside.</p>
			<p><i>Clean it all,</i> Lewa thought, moving on. <i>It must be cleaned.</i></p>
			<h2>10. Fire and Ice</h2>
			<p>Staring down at the krana throbbing within the Tahnok's bright red headplate, Kopaka fought off a shudder-not of cold, for the Toa of Ice never felt cold. Instead, he shuddered at the memory of what these creatures had done to his fiercely beautiful land.</p>
			<p>After leaving the others, he had hurried to his village, Ko-Koro. Thanks to its hidden location beneath an enormous ice field, the Bohrok hadn't come upon it yet.</p>
			<p>But when Kopaka explored the region further, he quickly realized he was too late. The Bohrok were already there. The Three Brothers Bridge, an ice bridge spanning a deep chasm between three glaciers, was melted into a puddle. Nearby, a valley once covered in blossoms of snow moss had been charred, leaving only a black hole in the ground to show where it had been.</p>
			<p>One word had burned itself into Kopaka's mind-<i>Tahnok.</i></p>
			<p>Kopaka had trailed the Tahnok to the slopes of Mount Ihu. He had battled the swarm with every bit of power he had, eventually managing to freeze one's fire shield into a block of ice while the others scattered in search of easier targets.</p>
			<p>But it was only a matter of time before more Bohrok broke through to Ko-Koro and finished what they had started-melting away the village as if it had never been. Kopaka had been tempted to stay with his villagers and lead them into battle. But he had decided that if the other Toa had discovered any important information about the enemy, he should be sure to find out.</p>
			<p>He had gone to Po-Wahi first, lingering there just long enough to lend some help to Pohatu, Gali, and Onua, who were fending off a swarm of Tahnok. Now he was going to see if Tahu was okay.</p>
			<p><i>Who would have guessed</i> I'd <i>be rushing around checking on the others?</i> he thought with a smile.</p>
			<p>As he continued on his way, he spied a red creature in the distance-much like a Tahnok in appearance, but quite a bit smaller. It was one of the smaller, more nimble beasts known as the Bohrok Va, which acted as scouts and messengers.</p>
			<p>Kopaka glanced around, expecting to see the rest of the swarm somewhere nearby. But there was no other sign of movement-just the solitary Tahnok Va climbing down the mountain toward the interior section of the island.</p>
			<p>"Odd," Kopaka said to himself, watching the creature curiously. "I wonder where it's going all by itself?"</p>
			<p>He skied down the slope, keeping the Tahnok Va in sight. The rendezvous with Tahu could wait-for now, it seemed more important to see where this creature was heading.</p>
			<p>Soon the Tahnok Va had led Kopaka down through the foothills of Mount Ihu into the area of cold, rocky plains lying between Ko-Wahi and Le-Wahi. It continued on until it reached a flat, low-lying area littered with enormous boulders.</p>
			<p><i>What is it doing?</i> Kopaka wondered, staying out of sight behind a boulder.</p>
			<p><i>CHKCHKCHKCHKCHK!</i></p>
			<p>Kopaka spun around just in time to avoid a noxious stream of yellowish-green liquid. The stream hit a cluster of boulders instead, and within seconds the solid rocks had melted away into nothing but a bit of greenish steam.</p>
			<p><i>Acid,</i> Kopaka thought grimly. <i>So these are the Lehvak.</i></p>
			<p>The green-colored Bohrok were swarming toward him, destroying everything in their path with spurts of their deadly acid. Kopaka lifted his ice blade, preparing to defend himself.</p>
			<p>But the swarms had no interest in him. They moved on to the east, straight toward the line of treetops visible in the distance.</p>
			<p><i>They are bringing their blight to the lands of Toa Lewa,</i> Kopaka thought. <i>I hope he is prepared to meet them.</i></p>
			<p>He turned to check on the progress of the little red creature he was following. But where was it? The Tahnok Va was nowhere to be seen.</p>
			<p>Kopaka scanned the horizon, puzzled and annoyed. There was no way the creature could have moved out of sight so quickly-not in this mostly open area. Where had it gone?</p>
			<p>He leaped onto the tallest boulder in the area, scanning the rock-strewn ground all around. He zeroed in on a cluster of especially large boulders, which formed a sort of ring-like a campfire circle for giants. There. It was the only place the Tahnok Va could be hiding.</p>
			<p>Leaping easily to another large rock, Kopaka kept his gaze trained on the circle of boulders.</p>
			<p><i>There,</i> he thought, his head swiveling to focus on a flash of movement to the west. <i>What was that?</i></p>
			<p>He stopped and stared. The movement came again-a flash of sunlight against polished bronze. A small creature came into sight-a Pahrak Va.</p>
			<p>The Pahrak Va trundled over the rocky ground, heading straight toward the circle of huge boulders. A moment later, it squeezed into a crevice between the two largest rocks and disappeared. Kopaka waited, but there was no further sign of the creature.</p>
			<p>Kopaka knew that with every second, the Bohrok were destroying still more of Mata Nui. But he needed to know what these Bohrok Va were up to. So he waited. And waited. Unlike some of the more impulsive Toa, Kopaka understood very well that it didn't always pay to be in a hurry.</p>
			<p>His patience paid off. Soon more Bohrok arrived and disappeared within the circle of rocks.</p>
			<p><i>All right,</i> Kopaka thought at last. <i>There must be at least half a dozen in that circle by now. I think it's time to see what they're doing in there.</i></p>
			<p>He stood and glanced forward at the ground, judging the distance. Then he prepared to jump-but stopped in shock with one foot held in the air.</p>
			<p>Bohrok! Dozens and dozens of them came pouring out of the rock circle, scattering in all directions.</p>
			<p>Kopaka blinked, wondering if his eyes were playing tricks on him. But no-just below the boulder where he stood, a swarm of Tahnok passed so close that he could feel the heat rising from their shiny red bodies.</p>
			<p>Of course. There had to be some sort of cave or tunnel in the center of those boulders. But a tunnel to where...?</p>
			<p>The stream of Bohrok stopped as suddenly as it had begun. Moments later, the creatures had disappeared, each swarm headed for a different region of Mata Nui.</p>
			<p>Kopaka knew what he had to do. Leaping to the ground, he strode toward the rock circle.</p>
			<p>When he reached it, he realized the boulders were even larger than they'd looked from a distance. Even the smallest rose many lengths above his head. Walking around the circle, Kopaka soon spotted an entrance burned straight through one of the rocks, large enough for several Bohrok to pass through side by side.</p>
			<p>He stepped through himself, ice blade at the ready. But it fell to his side in shock when he saw it.</p>
			<p>A tunnel.</p>
			<p>Not just a tunnel, but an enormous, yawning chasm in the ground. It plunged straight down into the earth, neither narrowing nor sloping before its depths were lost in the darkness below.</p>
			<p>And all around the walls, clambering up along steep channels carved in the stone, were more Bohrok. Dozens of them-no, hundreds. Ten times larger than any of the swarms he'd seen. Here and there a Bohrok Va scurried downward into the darkness, but the rest were moving in one direction only-upward, toward the surface. Toward the helpless lands of Mata Nui.</p>
			<p>Kopaka gulped. This wasn't what he had expected to find. And it changed everything...</p>
			<p>He was tempted to climb down those rough, narrow trails to search for some answers-but no. There were too many of them for Kopaka alone. He needed to find the others.</p>
			<p>He just hoped they weren't already too late.</p>
			<h2>11. The Betrayal</h2>
			<p>Onua walked steadily through the rocky wastes near the southern border of Po-Wahi, wondering how the battle was going back in Po-Koro. After meeting up with Pohatu and Gali and helping them set a trap for a swarm of marauding Tahnok, he had left them to spring the trap themselves. Kopaka had already departed to check on tahu, which left Lewa the only Toa unaccounted for. Onua had set out to find him.</p>
			<p><i>I hope Lewa is okay,</i> Onua thought with a flash of worry. <i>He can be so impulsive-acting without thinking, putting courage before caution. And these Bohrok swarms are really nothing for one Toa to tackle alone, no matter how bold and strong.</i></p>
			<p>That fact had become clearer with every passing hour. Everywhere he turned, Onua saw more of the Bohrok swarms-or the destruction they'd left behind. The creatures seemed willing to leave nothing untouched, from the trees to the rivers to the very land itself.</p>
			<p>He hadn't admitted it to the others, but Onua was truly worried about the Air Toa. Lewa had been gone a long time-Onua was starting to wonder if it hadn't been foolish to separate in the first place.</p>
			<p>Calling upon the power of his Kanohi mask for greater speed, he soon reached the region near Le-Koro. He slowed and looked around, noting the charred foliage and uprooted trees on all sides. He also noticed several steaming greenish puddles on the ground.</p>
			<p>"Acid," he muttered, not liking what this might mean.</p>
			<p>He stepped forward carefully, his senses on the alert. The last thing he wanted was to let the Bohrok take him by surprise.</p>
			<p>Suddenly Onua stopped, seeing something glinting golden in the sunlight.</p>
			<p>It was a Kanohi mask-Lewa's mask, lying on the ground abandoned. He bent to pick it up, not liking what this might mean.</p>
			<p>He walked on toward the outskirts of the treetop town. As he drew closer, Onua became aware of a sound somewhere ahead.</p>
			<p>Onua took a cautious step forward, then another. <i>This jungle makes me nervous,</i> he thought. <i>All I have to do is find Lewa, and then I can get out of here.</i></p>
			<p>"I don't think it's going to be that easy," a cold, metallic voice spoke from directly behind him.</p>
			<p>"Lewa!" Onua gasped-just as a mighty gust of wind sent him spinning backward onto the ground.</p>
			<h2>12. Friend and Foe</h2>
			<p>"Surprise," Lewa sneered through the pulsing krana mask. "I heard you were looking for me. So here I am!"</p>
			<p>Onua was speechless-it was Lewa, but this was not the Lewa he knew. The Air Toa wore a new mask now-a Bohrok's krana-and behind it, his eyes burned with anger.</p>
			<p>"Don't try to fight me, Onua. You can't win. We're too strong."</p>
			<p><i>Perhaps I should tunnel beneath him,</i> Onua thought uncertainly. <i>If I can knock him off balance long enough to get my hands on that krana...</i></p>
			<p>"Just go ahead and try it, earthworm," Lewa said with a laugh. There was no hint of the real Lewa in the voice. "You'll find the ground here a bit marshier than in your wormholes down in Onu-Wahi. You'll find me a bit quicker than a worm, too."</p>
			<p>"What-you-you read my thought's Lewa?" Onua stammered in surprise.</p>
			<p>Krana Lewa chuckled. "I am Bohrok Za, a squad leader," he said. "My telepathic powers are meant to communicate with my swarm. But your thoughts are so slow and transparent that I can read them with no effort at all."</p>
			<p>Onua frowned. His chances were not looking good at the moment. The creature before him had not only the ruthlessness of the Bohrok, but also the strength and knowledge of Toa Lewa. It seemed an invincible combination.</p>
			<p><i>But I have faced many invincible challenges before and prevailed,</i> he reminded himself. <i>Perhaps if I approach things another way...</i></p>
			<p>"There is no other way," Lewa hissed, leaping forward.</p>
			<p>There was no way Onua could dodge in time. He was flung backward and landed against a tree trunk with a thud. <i>When I went looking for Lewa, I didn't think success would be quite so painful,</i> he thought, shaking his head to clear it.</p>
			<p>When he stood, he saw Lewa watching him. Lewa's body twisted suddenly, as if fighting against itself. "Onua, get away from here-please!" Lewa blurted, the real Lewa. "Flee before I am forced to harm you."</p>
			<p>"I think I have a better idea," Onua muttered.</p>
			<p>He leaped forward, smashing the ground with his fists. A great wave of earth rose up like a tidal wave, sweeping toward Krana Lewa.</p>
			<p>But the infected Toa somersaulted easily over the passing quake. "Leave while there's still time," Lewa cried, his voice filled with pain. "I can feel the power building! Even your strength won't be able to defeat me soon."</p>
			<p>Onua wasn't sure what to try next. Lewa was strong in battle-too strong. He wasn't sure he could defeat him. But he certainly wasn't going to allow this-this krana thing to see that.</p>
			<p>Or was he right in thinking of Lewa that way? No matter what he might wear on his face, beneath the mask he was still Lewa-Toa, friend, hero.</p>
			<p>"I know the krana controls your body," he told Lewa calmly, lowering his arms to his side. "But not your will. If it is so strong that it can make you harm a friend, then go ahead. I will not defend myself. But I know you, Lewa. And I know you are stronger than this-this parasite."</p>
			<p>Reaching out, he clasped Lewa's hand in his own. He stared into his friend's eyes-looking past the sickly reddish glow of the krana mask, searching for the real Lewa beneath.</p>
			<p>"You are a Toa," Onua finished simply. "Prove yourself worthy of the name."</p>
			<p>And he waited to see what would happen.</p>
			<h2>13. The Nest</h2>
			<p>Tahu was uncharacteristically silent as he and Kopaka climbed the foothills at the base of the volcano. Though he didn't like to admit it, the Fire Toa was a bit awed by what the Ice Toa had just showed him-a nest of Bohrok. Tahu had been ready to charge down into the tunnel immediately, but Kopaka had convinced him to wait. It was time to join forces with the other Toa.</p>
			<p><i>I suppose he was right about that,</i> Tahu thought with a grimace. <i>I hate it when he's right.</i></p>
			<p>How much time had passed since the Bohrok had first appeared? Tahu wasn't sure; he'd been too busy fighting them to keep track. All he knew was that there seemed to be endless numbers of swarms and that their attacks were taking a toll on Mata Nui.</p>
			<p>They passed a jagged patch of ice jutting out of the rocks just ahead. Clearly, the Kohrak had been this way. Tahu waited until they had come even with the icy patch, then pointed his sword, blasting the ice into lava.</p>
			<p>Kopaka shot him an unreadable glance. "We will be needing all of our power soon," he commented. "Waste it not."</p>
			<p>Tahu scowled. "Waste?" he said. "The only thing wasted is your breath when you tell me what to do."</p>
			<p>"Yes, it seems so," Kopaka replied icily. "The Toa of Fire listens to none but himself."</p>
			<p>Tahu's scowl deepened. "Is that supposed to be an insult?" he said. "Because I-"</p>
			<p>Before he could finish his retort, a shout came from just down the slope.</p>
			<p>"Brother Tahu! Brother Kopaka! There you are!"</p>
			<p>Tahu had never been so glad to hear Gali's voice. He spun around and peered down the slope. Two figures were hurrying toward them.</p>
			<p>"Greetings, brothers!" Pohatu cried. "You'll be happy to hear that at least one Tahnok swarm is no more. What news do you have on your end?"</p>
			<p>Tahu clanked his fist against Pohatu's, then Gali's. "Serious news," he said. "Kopaka tracked one of the Bohrok Va back to its nest."</p>
			<p>"Nest?" Gali repeated curiously. "But how can that be? Nests are for birds and reptiles and other living things, while the Bohrok don't really live. They're just-"</p>
			<p>"-vehicles for the krana they carry within," Tahu finished for her with a nod. "Yes, we realize that now, too. But don't you see? The Bohrok and the krana emerged from this nest. That means-"</p>
			<p>"-that they spring from Mata Nui itself." This time it was Pohatu who finished the sentence. "They are not invaders from elsewhere, but creatures of the island just as all the others are."</p>
			<p>"Right." Gali looked at each of the other Toa in turn. "So why are they trying to destroy their own land?"</p>
			<p>Nobody had an answer for that. Finally Tahu shrugged. "We don't need to understand them," he pointed out, impatience welling up in him like lava. "We just need to stop them. So what are we waiting for?"</p>
			<p>"Onua and Lewa," Kopaka answered. "Where are they?"</p>
			<p>"No one has seen Lewa since we parted in Ta-Koro," Pohatu said. "Onua went to look for him, but we haven't seen him since then."</p>
			<p>Tahu was ready for action. "So let's send a search party, or-"</p>
			<p>"No need for that, brother Tahu," a voice sang out from behind a large stone outcropping. A moment later Lewa sprang into sight. He hurried toward the others.</p>
			<p>"Lewa!" Gali cried with relief. "Are you all right? You look a bit-er, strange."</p>
			<p>"And no wonder," Onua's familiar voice rang out from just behind Lewa. "Wait until you hear about the trouble our high-flying brother here got himself into."</p>
			<p>Tahu glanced at Lewa, expecting a quip or other playful comment, but the Toa of Air seemed uncharacteristically somber.</p>
			<p>"Yes, I suppose you should all know," Lewa said. "In case-well, just in case anything should-should happen."</p>
			<p>"What are you talking about, Lewa?" Gali asked with concern. "Did you have trouble with the Bohrok in Le-Wahi?"</p>
			<p>"You could say that," Lewa said quietly. "Not onlyjust me, either. Le-Koro-Le-Koro is no more." He bowed his head.</p>
			<p>Tahu wasn't sure what to say. He was used to Lewa being the flighty one among them, the lighthearted one who never took anything seriously. Seeing him like this was unsettling, to say the least. "What happened?" he asked gruffly as the silence stretched uncomfortably.</p>
			<p>"It was the Lehvak," Onua answered. "They captured the Le-Matoran and infected them by replacing their own masks with krana. And when lewa found them like that...Well, perhaps you'd better tell the rest, brother Lewa."</p>
			<p>Lewa looked uncomfortable. "I-they told me it was a physical entrapment only, that they needed the strength of a Toa to offmask the krana from their faces. I believed them. Why should I not? It is not in the nature of a Le-Matoran to falsespeak."</p>
			<p>"Unless in the interest of a practical joke," Tahu murmured under his breath. When Lewa looked over at him, he cleared his throat. "Er, I mean, didn't you remember what the Turaga said? That the krana, when worn, could steal the mind-even the mind of a Toa?"</p>
			<p>"I remember that now," Lewa admitted. "I didn't then. I was too quickminded to help. And so I leaped right into the helptask, and before I knew it, my Kanohi mask wa quicksnatched from one side while from the other, someone slipped the krana over my face. By the time I caught on, it was too late. I was...one of them."</p>
			<p>Tahu wasn't sure what to think. <i>How could that have happened?</i> he wondered uneasily. <i>How could ordinary Matoran-even a group of them, even with the cunning of the Bohrok guiding them-overpower a Toa?</i> He shook his head. <i>It would not have happened had it been me.</i></p>
			<p>he glanced around at the others. Gali and Pohatu were exchanging a worried glance. Kopaka was staring at Lewa intently, as if trying to dissect him with his gaze.</p>
			<p>Onua was the only one who seemed relaxed. "Don't look so fretful, my brothers and sister," he said. "In the end, brother Lewa overcame the krana's power on his own. I stood before him, allowing him to choose his own fate-and mine. And I was right. His will was strong enough to overcome the poison of the krana."</p>
			<p>"Only because you offered your own mindstrength to go with my own," Lewa said quietly. "Without that, I might never have found a way to self-free."</p>
			<p>"That's the way it usually happens, isn't it?" Gali pointed out. "Even when an enemy is too strong for one to face alone, together we can find a way to prevail."</p>
			<p>"Yes," Kopaka said. "And our greatest test of this unity comes now-as we go down into the nest."</p>
			<p>"Nest?" Onua repeated. "What nest? What are you talking about?"</p>
			<p>The others quickly filled him in on what Kopaka had discovered. Onua nodded as he listened to Kopaka and Tahu's description.</p>
			<p>"What about the krana?" he asked when they had finished. "Do we have all we need?"</p>
			<p>The six Toa quickly produced the krana they all still carried. It didn't take long to determine that they'd collected more than enough.</p>
			<p>"That one is the Krana Za," Lewa said, staring fixedly at one of the krana. "That's what I was-what was infecting me, I mean."</p>
			<p>Gali glanced at him with concern. "Yes, it's what <i>infected</i> you," she said. "But never think that it is what you were. Never think that you <i>became</i> the Bohrok, because you didn't."</p>
			<p>"Gali is right," Pohatu put in. "Lewa, whatever you've been through, it's time to forget about that and focus on what's ahead. We'll need all our wits about us-no distractions."</p>
			<p>"Yes, all right," Tahu said impatiently, not liking to think too much about Lewa's "infection". It made him uneasy-as if something alien had suddenly come into their midst. "Now come on. Let's go down to that nest and see if we can figure out what we're supposed to do with these krana."</p>
			<p>"How do we know we're supposed to take them underground, into the nest?" Gali wondered.</p>
			<p>Tahu shrugged. "How do we know we're not?"</p>
			<p>"But we still don't know anything about them," Onua added worriedly. "We don't even know why they want to destroy things, or why they chose this moment to emerge, or-"</p>
			<p>"Makuta," Lewa interjected suddenly. "It was Makuta. He released the manyswarms when we tried to awaken Mata Nui. It was not yet the right time, the time he had planned-but he out-sent them early, hoping to stop us."</p>
			<p>"What?" Pohatu stared at him. "How do you know that?"</p>
			<p>Lewa shrugged. "I don't know how," he said simply. "I just know."</p>
			<p>Tahu nodded, understanding suddenly. The infected mask-the krana-must have transferred some of the Bohrok's knowledge into Lewa's brain. But if such knowledge remained, what else might linger?</p>
			<p>The others continued to discuss possible courses of action. Kopaka and Lewa kept mostly silent, but the other three traded possibility after possibility.</p>
			<p>As he listened, Tahu could feel impatience bubbling up within him. "Come on!" he cried, interrupting Pohatu's suggestion to gather the Turaga together for a council to seek any further knowledge that might exist in the ancient legends. "We can stand around here all day while the Bohrok continue to destroy our island and endanger our people. Or we can take action!"</p>
			<p>"Tahu is right," Lewa spoke up at last. "We should hurry-go to the swarmnest. It's the only way."</p>
			<p>Though he was glad for the support, Tahu once again had to fight back a shudder of unease. Was this agreement really coming from Lewa, the impulsive one? Or was it coming from the mind of the swarm, luring them into a trap?</p>
			<p>Onua glanced around the group. "Does anyone have any objection to Tahu's plan?"</p>
			<p>There was a moment of silence. Gali and Kopaka traded a look, but both kept quiet.</p>
			<p>"Then it's decided," Onua said. "We will challenge the Bohrok in their nest."</p>
			<p>Tahu nodded. "The Bohrok cannot be allowed to endanger our people any longer."</p>
			<p>"No," Lewa reminded them. "The Bohrok are not the true enemy. It is the krana we must defeat. They have a purpose, a mission-it's why the exist."</p>
			<p>Pohatu shrugged. "Then they can tell us all about it-on their way off the island."</p>
			<h2>14. The Challenge</h2>
			<p>The six Toa wasted no time in traveling to the mouth of the nest. They climbed down its steep, rocky walls, avoiding the emerging Bohrok whenever possible and fighting them when not. Their progress was agonizingly slow, but eventually they left the glow of daylight behind and found themselves in a large, smooth tunnel leading deep into the earth.</p>
			<p>The darkness swallowed them up. Occasionally a group of Bohrok hurried past. By pressing against the walls, the Toa managed to avoid attracting their attention. Though they hated the thought of more swarms emerging into Mata Nui, they knew their energy might be needed for whatever they found at the end of the tunnel.</p>
			<p>Tahu found himself walking beside Onua. Lewa and Kopaka were walking close together at the front of the group, with Pohatu and Gali trailing just behind them.</p>
			<p>"Keep an eye on Lewa," Tahu murmured to his companion.</p>
			<p>"Do you think he is still influenced by the swarm?" Onua asked, glancing forward.</p>
			<p>"I don't know what to think. But nothing can be allowed to interfere with our mission.</p>
			<p>Onua chuckled. "Lewa would say you sound like a Bohrok, my friend."</p>
			<p>Tahu didn't bother to respond. Instead, he hurried forward to warn Pohatu not to let his guard down around Lewa.</p>
			<p>A few minutes later, there was a scraping sound as Pohatu ran his hand along the tunnel wall. "Have you noticed?" he commented, loudly enough for all to hear. "This tunnel wall-it's smooth. No Matoran dug this. Or any Bohrok, for that matter."</p>
			<p>"Are you sure?" Gali asked.</p>
			<p>"Gali, if there's one thing I know about, it's stone," Pohatu reminded her. His voice held its usual light tone, but there was an undercurrent of worry. "I think something is very wrong here."</p>
			<p>Gali didn't respond. <i>But whatever it is, we can handle it,</i> she thought. <i>At least, I hope we can.</i></p>
			<p>Just then Tahu shouted something from the front of the group. "What was that?" Gali asked Pohatu.</p>
			<p>"An opening," the Toa of Stone replied. "Tahu is going down to investigate."</p>
			<p>Gali nodded, watching as the Toa of Fire leaped off the edge of an opening in the floor. Moving forward with the others, she peered over the edge of the tunnel.</p>
			<p><i>KA-BLAMMMMM!</i></p>
			<p>Suddenly a stone door slid over the opening and slammed shut, blocking Tahu from view.</p>
			<p>"Tahu!" Onua cried. "He's trapped down there!"</p>
			<p>Pohatu's expression was grim. "And we may be trapped up here."</p>
			<p>The Toa spent the next moment or two trying to smash their way through the wall. But it refused to give, even after Onua's pounding and Pohatu's most devastating kicks.</p>
			<p>Left behind without Tahu's sword, the rest of them should have been standing in darkness. Kopaka was the first to notice that there was a reddish glow still lighting the tunnel. He pointed.</p>
			<p>"Molten lava!" he shouted.</p>
			<p>Spinning around, Gali saw that the Ice Toa was right. An enormous fireball was bearing down on them, filling the tunnel with its roaring, deadly energy. She desperately began pulling in water from the air around her, knowing that it was probably already too late. The only one who might be able to stop the lava now was-</p>
			<p>"Stay back!" Kopaka yelled. "My ice can hold the lava at bay for a few moments."</p>
			<p>He aimed his sword of ice, freezing the lava solid. Gali breathed out a sigh of relief, though she knew Kopaka was right-his defense would hold only a few minutes.</p>
			<p>Pohatu and Onua were still trying to break through the wall separating them from the armor. They pounded against the wall with power that could level a mountain. Still the wall stood, not even a scratch marring its smooth surface.</p>
			<p>"It doesn't shatter," Lewa shouted suddenly. "Doesn't shatter because it isn't there!"</p>
			<p>"What?" Pohatu gasped breathlessly.</p>
			<p>Lewa waved his arms, a hit of his old exuberance breaking through. "There's nothing you and Onua can't bring down," he exclaimed. "So if this wall is still standing, it can't be real! Stop believing in it-and it disappears!"</p>
			<p>With that, he stuck one arm straight through the solid wall. Pohatu blinked, hardly believing his eyes. How could this be? He struck at the wall, feeling the impact shake his whole body as his fist bounced off the impenetrable surface. Then he looked again at Lewa, who had disappeared halfway through the "wall" by this time.</p>
			<p>It couldn't be-and yet it was. The wall was nothing but an illusion! <i>What kind of creatures are we dealing with here, anyway?</i> Pohatu wondered, a shiver of dread coursing through him.</p>
			<p>Noticing that the other four Toa had disappeared through the wall, Pohatu took a deep breath. If they could do it, he could do it, too.</p>
			<p><i>Stand aside, wall,</i> he thought with a rueful smile. <i>If I can't get through you with my fists and feet, I suppose this way will do.</i></p>
			<p>Trusting his comrades' wisdom, he flung himself at the wall. This time, instead of bouncing off, he stumbled right through.</p>
			<p>He found himself standing with the others in a small chamber lit by a strange greenish glow.</p>
			<p>"What about Tahu?" Onua said. "We can't leave him back there."</p>
			<p>The others agreed. But before they could figure out what to do, Lewa pointed out that the ground was getting hot. Was it more lava? Or-</p>
			<p>"Everyone down," Kopaka barked. "NOW!"</p>
			<p>Kopaka rarely gave an order, but there was no disregarding his urgent tone this time. They all flung themselves to the floor-just as the cavern exploded around them.</p>
			<p>Dirt, stone, and lava flew in every direction. In the midst of it all was a tall red figure.</p>
			<p>"Tahu!" Lewa cried. "Are you all right?"</p>
			<p>Tahu nodded. Then, a little breathless, he explained that he'd used his sword to heat the air in the cavern where he'd been trapped-the heart of the Bohrok nest itself. The air pressure had finally blown apart the nest, scattering the remaning Bohrok to the far corners of the tunnels.</p>
			<p>Before the others could figure out what that might mean, they felt the ground giving way beneath them. The cavern floor groaned and split.</p>
			<p>"Uh-oh," Pohatu cried. "Looks like things are going downhill again."</p>
			<p>He tried to hold on to the walls, but the entire floor was falling away beneath his feet. He skidded through the yawning opening. All around him, he could see the other Toa falling as well.</p>
			<p>"Use your levitation powers!" Gali shouted.</p>
			<p>"And be ready for anything when we hit the bottom," Tahu added grimly.</p>
			<p>Each Toa called upon the levitation powers of his or her Kanohi mask, and they floated downward among the hail of falling stones and earth. The six of them finally landed in a massive, dimly lit, round chamber.</p>
			<p>Kopaka found some deep niches carved in the otherwise smooth floor. Their shapes matched the krana they carried.</p>
			<p>"I think this is where the krana are meant to go," he said, placing one of the krana he carried into the proper slot.</p>
			<p>The others followed suit. As Gali fitted the last of the krana into place, there was a sudden jerk in the floor below her.</p>
			<p>"Whoa!" she cried, grabbing onto Kopaka's arm to keep from being thrown to the ground. "What was that?"</p>
			<p>More violent tremors followed. The floor, walls, and ceiling of the cavern shuddered.</p>
			<p>"It's begun!" Lewa cried, barely keeping his feet as the earth shook and shuddered beneath him. "The end of the Bohrok!"</p>
			<p>"What do you mean, brohter?" Gali shouted.</p>
			<p>"What do you know?" Tahu cried at the same time.</p>
			<p>Before they could get any answers, the cavern walls groaned and fell away, revealing six enormous metal doors in the new wall. The doors slid back with a clang. Behind them were six identical tunnels shrouded in smoke and darkness.</p>
			<p>Onua stared into the nearest doorway. "It seems," he said slowly, "we've been invited in."</p>
			<h2>15. The Bohrok Queens</h2>
			<p>Each of the Toa stepped into the closest tunnel. Ahead, Lewa saw a dark glow. It held a strange shape-some kind of armor. Could it be?</p>
			<p>He hurried forward and saw that he'd been right-it was a suit of armor! Exo-Toa armor. He didn't know how he knew it was called that, he just knew. More knowledge left over from the krana that had infected him? Shrugging off the disturbing thought, he took a step closer to the armor.</p>
			<p><i>I suppose I'd better put it on,</i> he thought, touching the smooth surface of the armor. <i>I may need it.</i></p>
			<p>Soon he was outfitted in the armor. He felt new power seeping into his limbs and smiled. Then his smile faded as he felt a tug on the edges of his mind.</p>
			<p><i>Clean it all. It must be cleaned.</i></p>
			<p>"No!" he muttered aloud, shaking off the shadowy thoughts.</p>
			<p>Hurrying forward, his new armor clanking softly as he moved, Lewa wondered what he would find at the end of the tunnel.</p>
			<p><i>All obstacles must be removed.</i></p>
			<p>Lewa hesitated. Had that thought come from his mind? Was it the remains of the Bohrok's infection?</p>
			<p>"No," he muttered uncertainly. "It wasn't-I didn't..."</p>
			<p><i>You are an obstacle,</i> the mind-voice came again. <i>You must be removed.</i></p>
			<p>Lewa gasped as an enormous creature burst into view, the massive bulk of its gleaming red limbs and pearly fangs filling the tunnel. "What-what are you?" the Toa cried in surprise.</p>
			<p>This time knowing laughter filled his mind. <i>You know who I am, Toa of the Bohrok,</i> the voice taunted. <i>You know me-I am your queen. My sister, Cahdok, and I rule your thoughts, your actions.</i></p>
			<p>"No!" Lewa shouted furiously. "I <i>do</i> know who you are, Gahdok." The name had popped into his mind as if planted there. "But you are sorrywrong about me. You don't rule me, and you never will!"</p>
			<p>With that, he lashed out furiously. But the creature before him knocked him aside easily, sending him spinning into the hard tunnel wall.</p>
			<p><i>You are wrong about that, Toa of Nothing,</i> the mind-voice hissed. <i>Dead wrong.</i></p>
			<p>More voices started to whisper within Lewa's head-the voices of the swarm, calling him to fulfill their destiny. Gritting his teeth, Lewa did his best to ignore them.</p>
			<p><i>I have to fight back,</i> he told himself. <i>I am a Toa.</i></p>
			<p>He raised his arms, focusing his powers on the air around him. But all that came to him was a whisper of a breeze.</p>
			<p><i>What's happening?</i> Lewa wondered desperately as the voices gained in volume. <i>What's badwrong with me?</i></p>
			<p>He fell to his knees, pressing his hands against his ears. Still the voices filled his mind.</p>
			<p><i>Cleanitallitmustbecleanedallobstacleswillberemovedyouareanobstacleremoveyourselfcleanitallcleanitallcleanitall...</i></p>
			<p>"Help!" Lewa cried. "Someone, over here! Quickly-please!"</p>
			<p>Kopaka rushed to his side. Lewa was dimly aware that the Ice Toa was dressed in Exo-Toa armor of his own.</p>
			<p>"Drive it back to the cavern," Kopaka said tersely. "We can't fight it here."</p>
			<p>Lewa breathed out in relief. Miraculously, Kopaka's cool, no-nonsense voice had sent the voices away. Nearby, Gahdok roared in fury.</p>
			<p>"Use the armor," Kopaka told Lewa. "Let its power work for you."</p>
			<p>Lewa glanced down at himself, realizing he hadn't even bothered to examine his new powers. But he would make up for that now.</p>
			<p>Noting the electro-rocket on one arm, he raised it and pointed it toward Gahdok. Beside him, Kopaka did the same. The creature gnashed her teeth and roared again, but she backed off a few steps, moving down the corridor in the direction of the cavern.</p>
			<p>"She's awaymoving!" Lewa cried.</p>
			<p>Kopaka nodded. "Go find the others," he said. "They should be ready."</p>
			<p>Lewa didn't hesitate. He ducked pas the creature. Careening down the passageway, he burst out into the cavern.</p>
			<p>"It's coming! he shouted. "Kopaka is driving the creature-queen this way."</p>
			<p>Gali, Pohatu, and Onua were in the cavern. All of them wore Exo-Toa armor.</p>
			<p>Pohatu glanced at Lewa. "Tahu has the other creature on the move, too," he reported. "When they're both in here, we can surround them and take them down."</p>
			<p>"Good," Lewa murmured. "That will be the end of the Bohrok threat."</p>
			<p>He wasn't sure how he knew that, but he knew it for sure. If they could only defeat Cahdok and Gahdok, the Bohrok would be finished.</p>
			<p>Before he could tell the others, there was a shout. Tahu had just driven a large, silvery-blue version of Gahdok into the chamber-her sister, Cahdok. A second later, Gahdok herself backed in from the tunnel, goaded by Kopaka.</p>
			<p>"Drive them to the center of the chamber!" Onua called. "Surround them!"</p>
			<p>But the two queens were already backing toward each other. Soon they were side by side in the center of the cavern.</p>
			<p>"Strike now, Toa," Tahu roared. "For your villages and your people!"</p>
			<p>Lewa leaped forward with the others, raising his rocket arm. He aimed and let it blast right at Cahdok and Gahdok. The other Toa did the same.</p>
			<p>But the rocket blasts exploded helplessly several yards in front of the sisters. Cahdok and Gahdok screeched with triumph.</p>
			<p>"What's wrong?" Onua asked, his voice filled with awe. "It's as if they're surrounded by some kind of force field!"</p>
			<p>Suddenly Lewa knew the answer. It filled his mind, even as the queens of the swarm taunted the other Toa in their thought-speak.</p>
			<p><i>Fools!</i> Gahdok hissed in the Toa's minds. <i>By bringing us together, you increase our power! Now Mata Nui will be as it was in the Before-Time. All that does not belong will be removed-beginning with you!</i></p>
			<p>Lewa gasped in horror. Now that the sisters were together, their powers knew few limits.</p>
			<p><i>Why didn't I know this would happen?</i> Lewa thought in frustration. <i>I should have remembered-from before. I should have been able to warn the others.</i></p>
			<p>But it was too late for that now. The queens had suddenly gone on the offensive-Cahdok showered Kopaka with a hailstorm of stones, while Gahdok blasted Gali with smothering heat.</p>
			<p><i>Did I betray the other Toa?</i> Lewa wondered uneasily. <i>Did I lead them into this trap-could the Bohrok still be controlling me, even if I don't realize it?</i></p>
			<p>No. It hadn't been his idea to bring Gahdok to the cavern-Kopaka had been the one to suggest that. The thought filled Lewa with relief.</p>
			<p><i>Don't feel too glad, Toa of Weakness,</i> the sisters taunted Lewa in his mind. <i>For we have powers that will make your blood run cold...</i></p>
			<p>"Nooo!" Lewa cried, but the words froze in his throat as Gahdok turned her icy gaze on him, freezing him in place.</p>
			<p>Meanwhile, the others were calling upon all of their powers to battle the sisters. Tahu blasted Gahdok with fire, but she retaliated with a barrage of hurtling stones.</p>
			<p>"Tahu!" Lewa cried in horror, his half-frozen mouth barely forming the name. With an effort, Lewa turned his ice-encrusted eyes toward Onua and Pohatu, hoping they would come to Tahu's rescue. To his surprise, he saw that both were busy fighting-but neither appeared to have an opponent!</p>
			<p><i>More of the sisters' illusions,</i> Lewa thought desperately.</p>
			<p>Just in time, the Toa of Fire used the power of the Mask of Shielding to block the stones. But Lewa could see that he was struggling to maintain the protective shield.</p>
			<p>Nearby, Gali was fighting to stay upright as wave after wave of nauseating heat rolled over her. She didn't understand what was happening. Somehow, her elemental power had deserted her-she couldn't even manage to call forth a trickle, let alone a flood, to fight the two queens. SHe could see that Tahu was having similar troubles-and the sisters were closing in on him.</p>
			<p>"Onua! Pohatu!" Gali shouted. "You are fighting shadows! Tahu nees you!"</p>
			<p>Luckily her words got through to Pohatu. <i>Shadows?</i> He stared at the hulking metallic monster before him. It reared up, preparing a devastating strike with its hooked claw.</p>
			<p>"Forget it, brother shadow," Pohatu spat out, disgusted with himself for falling for the sisters' tricks.</p>
			<p>He stood firm as the shadow creature struck. The claw passed right through him and disappeared in a whiff of smoke.</p>
			<p>Pohatu whirled around, knocking Onua on the shoulder. "Brother!" he cried. "Leave that shadow alone-we have to help Tahu!"</p>
			<p>Without waiting for an answer, he rushed forward and flung the largest rock he could find toward the queens. But they deflected it easily, tossing it aside. Pohatu growled in frustration, looking around for another boulder.</p>
			<p>"All of you!" Tahu shouted suddenly. "Shed your armor! It hinders our elemental powers-and they are our only hope!"</p>
			<p>Of course! Pohatu ripped off the Exo-Toa armor. Though he immediately felt power seeping away, he also felt his own natural strength swell to replace it.</p>
			<p>Tahu was still struggling against the queens.</p>
			<p><i>It's no use,</i> the Fire Toa thought desperately. <i>They're too strong! How can we hope to fight them?</i></p>
			<p><i>The knowing will come.</i></p>
			<p>The words filled his mind. Suddenly he knew what to do.</p>
			<p>"Toa!" Tahu shouted. "Surround them! We must combine our powers."</p>
			<p>Lewa leaped forward with the others. But he couldn't help worrying-what if this was another trap? What if the queens had tricked them into attacking without the protection of their powerful armor? If the Toa perished, who would be left to protect their people?</p>
			<p>"But-the danger," he cried as the others moved toward the hissing, screeching queens.</p>
			<p>Gali glanced at him in surprise. "The safety of our people is worth any risk," she said. "If power is all these creatures understand, then we will show them power."</p>
			<p>Tahu nodded tersely. "Let's go," he said. "Lewa, either join us or get out of the way."</p>
			<p>Lewa stared at the Fire Toa, seeing a question in his eyes. Could Lewa give the right answer to that question? Did he know the right answer? Suddenly he was certain that he did.</p>
			<p>"Yes," Lewa said at last. "You are true-right. It's worth the risk."</p>
			<p>Tahu smiled at him for a second, looking relieved. For the first time since Lewa had been overtaken by the krana, there was no suspicion or doubt in the Fire Toa's eyes.</p>
			<p>Then Lewa joined the others in forming a ring around Cahdok and Gahdok. He closed his eyes, summoning all the power he could find within himself. Just when he'd reached the bottom, he felt Gali's hand grasp his shoulder. A new wave of power swept through him.</p>
			<p>A howling gale swept through the cavern, sweeping the sisters into a maelstrom.</p>
			<p>Soon a driving rain hammered down on the queens.</p>
			<p>Seconds later the rain froze to deadly hail.</p>
			<p>A shower of stones pounded the enemy from every direction.</p>
			<p>Waves of earth rose up around them.</p>
			<p>Blasts of fire heated the stone and earth into steaming lava.</p>
			<p>"Keep it up, brothers!" Gali shouted. "We're winning!"</p>
			<p><i>Fools!</i> Gahdok's words seared through the Toa's minds like poison. The queens were writhing in agony as the Toa's attack continued. <i>You think you have won-but you cannot imagine what you have unleashed!</i></p>
			<p>Then, suddenly, the energy sizzling around the queens condensed into a gel-like substance. <i>Protodermis,</i> thought Gali in confusion. The mysterious substance had been mined on Mata Nui for years, its origins unknown. And now it had formed a barrier around the queens, imprisoning them within!</p>
			<p>Before she could understand the significance of this protodermis cage, Gali heard a deafening rumble as stones rained down from above and the earth erupted below.</p>
			<h2>16. A New Beginning</h2>
			<p>"Looks like Cahdok and Gahdok had one more surprise for us!" Onua shouted as he tried to stay upright.</p>
			<p>Lewa shook his head. "This is not their doing," he called back, the knowledge strong in his mind. "This comes from the heart of Mata Nui."</p>
			<p>"The floor!" Gali cried. "We're sinking!"</p>
			<p>Before anyone could respond, the ground fell away beneath them. Tahu found himself sliding down a long, narrow tube. Its walls were clear, allowing him to see the other Toa trapped within similar tubes.</p>
			<p><i>What now?</i> the Fire Toa thought rather desperately. <i>Just when we think we've finally won-</i></p>
			<p>Just then the tube ended abruptly. Tahu found himself flying through the air for a split second, and then-</p>
			<p><i>SPLASSSSSH-ZZZZZZT!</i></p>
			<p>He was enveloped in a gel-like substance halfway between liquid and solid. The gel cushioned him, seeping into every joint, making him feel warm and cold by turns.</p>
			<p><i>Protodermis,</i> Tahu thought fuzzily. The substance seemed to be seeping into his mind as well as his body, making it difficult to think or move. <i>We're swimming in protodermis.</i></p>
			<p>The mysterious substance had been mined on Mata Nui for years, used as a source of power. What effect would it have on the Toa?</p>
			<p>The Toa of Fire closed his eyes, feeling the protodermis surround him. He wanted to struggle, to fight his way to the surface. But he couldn't move.</p>
			<p>An immense heat swept through his body, his blood boiling and white-hot flames flickering behind his eyelids. As soon as the heat had come it disappeared, replaced by an icy cold so deep that Tahu couldn't even shiver. Within a fraction of a second, he felt himself sinking into warm, welcoming water, deep and pure. Then the water evaporated away into a howling wind that swept him around and around-until he landed on the hard earth and felt himself sinking down, down, down into the stifling depths. Finally he hit the hard surface of a stone cliff, and behind his still-closed eyes it was as if he could see right through it until it held no mysteries.</p>
			<p>Then the stone, too, fell away. For a long moment there was nothingness.</p>
			<p>With a gasp, Tahu broke through the surface of the protodermis. Coughing and choking for breath, he looked around and saw the other Toa surfacing nearby.</p>
			<p>They levitated up in a group, landing on a rocky ledge above the bubbling pit of protodermis. The cavern was empty. Cahdok and Gahdok had disappeared. But the Toa were even more shocked by the changes they saw in one another.</p>
			<p>Each of them was still recognizable-but they had all changed. Instead of his golden Kanohi mask, Tahu's face was now covered in a larger mask of gleaming red, while his body shimmered in metallic tones of silver and bronze. The others had undergone similar transformations.</p>
			<p>"What has happened?" Gali voiced the question at last. "What have we become?"</p>
			<p>"More than we were," Kopaka answered, his cool voice tinged with the warmth of amazement. "More than anyone has ever been."</p>
			<p>Sure enough, Tahu could feel power surging through him. But he glanced upward with concern. "Let us worry about why it happened later," he said. "There are more important questions to answer now. What happened to Cahdok and Gahdok? And how are we going to get out of here?"</p>
			<p>The last question turned out to be the easiest to answer. Lewa's power of levitation carried them aloft, and soon they were bursting out of the darkness of the tunnels onto the surface. They flew high up into the air until they could see the island from end to end. While there were enormous areas of bare earth, charred rock, and other damage, the Bohrok swarms were nowhere to be seen.</p>
			<p>"We did it!" Gali cried as the Toa settled back toward the ground. "The threat of the swarms is ended! But at what price?"</p>
			<p>Tahu couldn't help wondering the same thing as he glanced at Lewa. But he shook off the nagging distrust of the Air Toa's mind.</p>
			<p>"Nothing has been lost," the Fire Toa said firmly. "The protodermis has given us the power to protect our people from any danger and to heal the land. Once we were Toa-but now we are far, far more." He raised his magma sword, reveling in the power surging through him. "Now and forevermore, we are-the Toa Nuva!"</p>
			<p>The cheers of the other Toa Nuva rose into the air. Mata Nui had been injured-but soon it would heal. The Toa Nuva would see to that.</p>
			<p>And they would see to it that Makuta never again troubled this beautiful island-if he even bothered to try. Was this the end of their battles against the darkness? Tahu wondered.</p>

					<h1>BIONICLE Chronicles #3: Makuta's Revenge</h1>
			<h3>C. A. Hapka</h3>
			<h2>1. Underground</h2>
			<p>Deep beneath the island of Mata Nui, in a cavern so far below the surface that no ray of light had ever pierced its darkness, a pair of glowing red eyes stared out of a huge, shadowy face. Unblinking, the eyes turned upward, seeing far beyond what lay before them, through rock and earth and sand, all the way to the distant sunlit surface.</p>
			<p>"Soooooooooo..." a deep, ominous voice breathed into the empty cave. "Toa. You have defeated the Bohrok swarms...as it was foreseen. And in doing so, you have called forth the instrument of your own doom."</p>
			<p>The red eyes blinked and narrowed.</p>
			<p>"And though the prophecies of the Matoran may sing of the Toa's might, we shall soon see that even the spirit of a hero can be broken." The dark voice sounded pleased. "The time has come-time to awaken the next protectors of Mata Nui's slumber. It is left to them to avenge the defeat of their Bohrok brothers. And to preserve things as they should be...as they must be...forever."</p>
			<h2>2. Symbols and Secrets</h2>
			<p>"Look out below!"</p>
			<p>Pohatu Nuva glanced up as he stepped out into the sandy main street of the desert village of Po-Koro. A hail of stone rained down from the wall that surrounded the village.</p>
			<p>"Good job," he called to the workers atop the wall. "At this rate, you'll have this section of the wall repaired before sunset."</p>
			<p>"Thank you for the kind words, Toa!" one of the workers called back.</p>
			<p>Pohatu glanced at Turaga Onewa, the leader of the village, who had followed him outside. "They'd better be careful about calling me 'Toa' like that," he joked. "Especially when Toa Tahu is listening. It's supposed to be 'Toa Nuva' now."</p>
			<p>Onewa chuckled. "Indeed," he agreed. "There have been a lot of changes on Mata Nui since you and the other Toa arrived."</p>
			<p>"Yes." Pohatu looked down at himself, still a little amazed at the changes in his own body. It was stronger and sleeker than ever, with gleaming silver armor highlighting his bronze-and-gold limbs and torso. His mask had changed, too-instead of its old, bulletlike shape, it was ridged and spiky and provided him with even stronger powers of speed.</p>
			<p>There was another shout from the direction of the village wall. Pohatu and Onewa watched as several large, beetlelike creatures hauled a large chunk of stone toward the broken section. A villager pointed and called out, and the creatures obediently turned slightly to the left.</p>
			<p>"Who would have thought it?" Pohatu said. "Not so long ago we were fighting the Bohrok swarms. Now they're helping us repair the damage they caused."</p>
			<p>"It is amazing indeed, Toa of Stone," Onewa agreed. "I must admit, I was not certain it was the right decision, letting the Bohrok swarms into the villages so soon after you and the other Toa defeated their queens."</p>
			<p>"How could it be the wrong decision?" Pohatu said. "After all, it's one of the few things we six Toa have agreed upon since we arrived here."</p>
			<p>It hadn't been long ago that he and the other Toa had first awakened on this island of Mata Nui. Even though the Toa were six heroes with one destiny, they didn't always find it easy to work together. But they had come together when it counted, most recently to defeat the Bohrok swarms sent by Makuta. In the end, the Toa had trapped the twin queens of the swarm, Cahdok and Gahdok-first with the help of the powerful Exo-Toa armor they had discovered in the queens' underground lair and then by releasing the mysterious substance known as protodermis. At the same time, the Toa were exposed to the protodermis themselves and emerged from it changed-into the Toa Nuva.</p>
			<p>"Besides," Pohatu went on as he watched the Bohrok maneuver a square chunk of rock toward the wall, "we know now that it was the krana-the mysterious beings they carried with them-that controlled them. Now that the krana have been removed, there is no reason to fear the swarms anymore."</p>
			<p>"Turaga! Turaga!" a shout interrupted their conversation. They turned to see a villager racing toward them.</p>
			<p>"What is it, Hewkii?" Onewa asked as the Matoran skidded to a stop before them.</p>
			<p>Hewkii gave a slight bow. "Forgive the interruption, Pohatu Nuva," he said. "But something extraordinary has just happened."</p>
			<p>Pohatu and Onewa followed as Hewkii hurried back toward the center of the village. He led them to the village shrine known as the Po-Suva. A crowd of Po-Matoran had gathered there, clustered near the suva's entrance.</p>
			<p>"Move aside!" Hewkii shouted. "Let the Toa Nuva and the Turaga see."</p>
			<p>The villagers moved aside, murmuring with wonder. Pohatu saw a bronze-colored object hovering just above the ground.</p>
			<p>"What is it?" he wondered aloud, taking a step forward. It was about the size of his mask, with carved lines forming an angular pattern in its smooth surface.</p>
			<p>Turaga Onewa took in a sharp breath.</p>
			<p>"What?" Pohatu glanced at him. "Do you know what that thing is?"</p>
			<p>The Turaga frowned and began to tremble. "It is as it was foreseen..."</p>
			<p>Tahu Nuva, the Toa of Fire, watched as Turaga Vakama set the strange object into a niche in the wall of the Ta-Suva, the village's sacred shrine.</p>
			<p>"I still don't understand what it is," he said. "You say it's an icon-a symbol of my power. But what is its purpose? Where did it come from?"</p>
			<p>"That cannot be said, Tahu Nuva," Vakama replied, bowing before the icon. "It is a mystery shrouded in the mists of the past."</p>
			<p>"Yes," Tahu murmured with a twinge of annoyance. "There seems to be a lot of those."</p>
			<p>Tahu stepped outside the suva, but Vakama followed. "Tahu Nuva," he said. "Please come back inside for a moment. I have something of importance to discuss with you." Vakama drew the Toa back into the dark quiet of the suva. "I have been consulting with the Turaga of the other villages. We wanted to make sure you and the other Toa Nuva know that there is still work to be done-that becoming Toa Nuva does not end with your new looks and strength. There is a new set of Kanohi masks you must find to truly make use of all your new powers."</p>
			<p>"New masks?" Tahu grimaced slightly. Soon after the Toa's arrival on Mata Nui, they had set out to find the sets of Kanohi masks that would give them great powers. They had been hidden all over the island, and Makuta had set his vicious minions, the Rahi, to guard them.</p>
			<p>"It should not be such a difficult task this time," the Turaga said. "As you know, the Rahi no longer answer to Makuta. And with the Bohrok no longer a threat..."</p>
			<p>"...finding the masks should be as easy as a nice game of kolhii," Tahu finished. "All right. I suppose it's better to get this out of the way. Can you manage here without me for a while?"</p>
			<p>"Of course," Vakama replied. "But..." His voice trailed off.</p>
			<p>"Yes? What is it?" Tahu did his best to keep impatience out of his voice. "Is there something else?"</p>
			<p>"There is." Vakama shifted his firestaff to the opposite hand. "I-I don't know if the time is right. I don't know if any time would be right for this. And the wrong decision..."</p>
			<p>"Yes, what are you saying?" Tahu demanded. It wasn't like Vakama to sound so hesitant. The Turaga was usually much more like Tahu himself-quick-thinking and decisive. "What's the big secret?"</p>
			<p>Taking a deep breath, Vakama reached into an opening in the wall and pulled something out.</p>
			<p>Tahu stared at the item curiously. "What is that?" he asked, reaching toward it. "It looks sort of like a mask-but not any mask I've ever seen."</p>
			<p>Vakama held up the object. Its surface gleamed a deep flame orange.</p>
			<p>"It <i>is</i> a mask," Vakama said, his voice low and reverent. "The Kanohi Vahi-the Great Mask of Time. It is the most powerful mask of them all."</p>
			<p>"Really?" Tahu reached out eagerly.</p>
			<p>But Vakama pulled it out of reach. "Wait," he said, his voice so serious and commanding that Tahu lowered his hand in surprise. "You must understand what this power means."</p>
			<p>Tahu frowned, irritated. "I am a Toa Nuva," he reminded Vakama haughtily. "I know all about the use of power."</p>
			<p>Still, Vakama held the Vahi mask away. He shook his head. "This is not the kind of power you have known," he said. "Your other powers are great indeed. But the power of the Vahi exists on a higher level. Do you understand what it would mean to control time itself?"</p>
			<p>Tahu paused, turning over the question in his head. "I-I suppose it would be useful in battle," he said. "I could slow down time for my opponent, giving me the chance to defeat him before he could even complete a strike. Or I could use it instead of the mask of speed, quickening time to get me somewhere faster. Or..."</p>
			<p>"No!" Vakama sighed. "This is what I feared. You must think of the greater reality, Toa Tahu. For he who controls time controls reality-controls <i>everything.</i> Do you see?"</p>
			<p>"I see that time connects all other powers," Tahu said slowly. "Nothing else can exist without it."</p>
			<p>"Yes!" Vakama sounded pleased and relieved, though his voice still held an undercurrent of worry. "Now you begin to understand. It's one thing to control time and with it all of reality-and another to <i>lose</i> control of it all. The Kanohi Vahi can only be used in the direst emergency-when there is nothing to lose."</p>
			<p>Tahu paused. "But, I might never reach such a state of desperation at all," he said. "I might never find a chance to call upon the Vahi."</p>
			<p>"That is my hope," Vakama said. "In fact, I think it would be better if the other Toa never know you hold it unless you need to use it. Can you accept that, Tahu Nuva?"</p>
			<p>Tahu thought for a moment, struggling with the idea. To have the most powerful mask of all and never to use it...never to let on that it existed...Could he really maintain such a secret?</p>
			<p>"Why me?" he blurted. "Why should I be the one to be given this responsibility?"</p>
			<p>"Why does anything on Mata Nui happen as it does?" Vakama responded. "We cannot know. We can only accept our destiny."</p>
			<p>Tahu sighed. Unity, duty, destiny-such were the ideas the Matoran lived by. He glanced at Vakama, who was watching him carefully. How much did Vakama and the other Turaga really know about the Toa's destiny? He wondered. Did they see more of the future and the past than they told?</p>
			<p>"All right," he said at last. "I will do my best to protect this mask-and its secrets."</p>
			<p>He reached again for the Kanohi Vahi. And this time Vakama allowed him to take it.</p>
			<h2>3. Pride and Power</h2>
			<p>"Don't be late, don't be late," Lewa Nuva, Toa of Air, sang to himself as he launched himself off a cliff near the edge of Le-Wahi.</p>
			<p><i>Don't be late.</i> It was the last thing Toa Onua had said to him when the six Toa Nuva had parted ways.</p>
			<p>The other five Toa Nuva were waiting when Lewa finally reached the meeting spot. Gali smiled at him, and Pohatu gave a friendly wave.</p>
			<p>"Greetings, brothers," Lewa called. "And sister," he added with a wink at Gali, the Toa of Water. "Did I latemiss anything important?"</p>
			<p>Onua, the Toa of Earth, greeted him with a nod. "We have just recently arrived ourselves. But how are things in Le-Koro, brother?" he asked in his deep, rumbling voice. "We have all wondered."</p>
			<p>Lewa's smile faded as he thought of the rubble that was all that had remained of his treebright village after the Bohrok got through with it. If only he had fought harder to resist the power of that krana...He shuddered as he remembered the horrible feeling that had come over him when one of the krana had taken over his mind.</p>
			<p>He shook his head, refusing to dwell any longer on such things. The past was past, and even a Toa could not change time.</p>
			<p>"We are hardworking," he said. "There is much to do, but we are making progress."</p>
			<p>"That is good to hear, Lewa," Gali said. "Let us know if you are in need of our help."</p>
			<p>Lewa shrugged. "Manythanks, Gali," he replied. "But with my new powers, I truedoubt I will need much help with anything."</p>
			<p>"Indeed." It was always a surprise when Kopaka Nuva, the Toa of Ice, had anything to say. But now his cool voice cut into the conversation. "I fail to see why any of us need to bother with these meetings any longer. Not until we discover how to awaken Mata Nui." It was the Toa's ultimate goal to reawaken the Great Spirit for whom the island had been named.</p>
			<p>"Let's not be hasty, brother Kopaka," Gali said. "Even our new power doesn't mean we can go it alone from here on in."</p>
			<p>"Oh, really? Watch this." Lewa flung his katana blade upward, calling upon the power of the wind. It swept down with a roar, lifting the other Toa Nuva off their feet.</p>
			<p>"Take care where you point that power of yours, brother Lewa," Tahu Nuva growled as he leaped to his feet. "You might find yourself in hot water..." He sent a blast of flame out of his magma sword.</p>
			<p>Lewa somersaulted out of the way just in time. "Is that the best you can do, Tahu Nuva?"</p>
			<p>Before long all of the toa Nuva had joined in, each trying to overwhelm the others with a show of his or her new powers. Pohatu unleashed a tornad of stones. Onua started an avalanche on a nearby slope. Tahu and Kopaka battled with their opposing powers of heat and cold. Even Gali sent a mighty flood gushing out from her new aqua axes.</p>
			<p>Finally, though, the Toa Nuva lost interest in the game. "Well, that was fun," Pohatu said breathlessly. "What will we do for an encore?"</p>
			<p>Gali looked sheepish. "As Toa Nuva, we have greater control than ever before," she said. "It is a shame we cannot control our tempers as well."</p>
			<p>"We are all on edge, Gali," Pohatu said soothingly. "The struggle with Cahdok and Gahdok-our transformation into the Toa Nuva..."</p>
			<p>"Not to mention rebuilding our villages," Lewa added, his mind wandering back to Le-Koro. His hands quivered slightly, impatient to get back to work helping with the repairs.</p>
			<p>"Maybe it would be best for us to go our separate ways for now," Tahu put in. "Our villages need us more than we need one another."</p>
			<p>"I agree," Kopaka said. "This alliance is no longer necessary."</p>
			<p>Gali looked dismayed. "Split apart-again? Have we learned nothing from the past?"</p>
			<p>Lewa shrugged. He liked Gali, but in his opinion she had always put a little too much emphasis on the <i>unity</i> part of the Matoran's favorite saying, even when it didn't seem necessary.</p>
			<p>"This is a mistake," Gali pleaded. "I can feel it. Please-what if we are needed once more? What if some new danger threatens Mata Nui?"</p>
			<p>"We will tug that vine when we come to it, watersister," Lewa called over his shoulder. "Quickspeed to you-I am out of here."</p>
			<p>Soon Lewa was sailing in for a landing on the outskirts of the village. He could see that the Matoran had made progress even in the short time he'd been away.</p>
			<p>There was a crashing sound in the brush nearby. Lewa glanced toward it, expecting to see an animal. Instead, a Tahnok Va-a scout of the fiery Tahnok breed of Bohrok-emerged.</p>
			<p><i>News...news ahead.</i></p>
			<p>The thought slipped easily into Lewa's mind. He shuddered slightly. Because of his experience with the krana, Lewa was the only Toa who could hear and understand the Bohrok's communication. He still couldn't quite get used to the fact that the swarms still had access to his mind, though it had certainly come in handy.</p>
			<p>"What news?" he asked the Tahnok Va, ignoring his own uneasy feelings. "What's happening? Is something badwrong at the village?"</p>
			<p><i>No...no...nothing wrong...</i></p>
			<p>With that, the Tahnok Va turned and scurried away into the jugle. Lewa frowned after it for a moment. Nothing wrong-he hoped that was true. It was still hard to trust the Bohrok sometimes after all that had happened.</p>
			<p>Whatever the news, Lewa figured he would know soon enough. He grabbed the closest vine and swung upward. "I'm back, little ones," he called as he landed.</p>
			<p>He need not have bothered. The entire population of the village was already gathered nearby. The Le-Matoran let out a cheer.</p>
			<p>"Welcome back, Toa," Turaga Matau called. "We've been waiting for you. We just finished repairing your suva and we can finally put your power icon in its proper place in the heart of the village."</p>
			<p>Lewa nodded. He had nearly forgotten about the strange floating symbol that had appeared out of nowhere earlier that day.</p>
			<p>"And don't forget the celebration!" a voice shouted from the crowd.</p>
			<p>"A celebration?" Lewa said. "What are we waiting for? Let's get started!"</p>
			<p>A cheer rang out from the gathered villagers. Soon someone was playing a lively tune on a Madu-shell xylophone, and Matoran were dancing, leaping, and swinging playfully on nearby vines.</p>
			<p>Turaga matau put a hand on Lewa's arm. "Before you join the party, would you like to see the suva?" he asked.</p>
			<p>"Sure," Lewa replied. He followed the Turaga toward a mound-shaped structure at the center of the village.</p>
			<p>Inside, the woven walls allowed only a dim glow of soothing green light to seep in from outside. At the center of the small, round room was a solid stone shelf.</p>
			<p>A niche had been cut into the stone. Resting in it was the symbol.</p>
			<p>Lewa gazed at it curiously. It was square and intricately carved out of a greenish stonelike substance. Where had it come from? What did it mean?</p>
			<p>He didn't wonder about it for long. "Very nice," he told the Turaga. "But enough symbolgazing. Let's get out there and have some partyfun!"</p>
			<p>Soon he and Matau had rejoined the gleeful crowd on the platform. As he danced and laughed along with his villagers, Lewa could feel some of the tension of the recent battles draining away.</p>
			<p><i>If only stuffy old Kopaka could see us now!</i> Lewa thought with a grin. <i>Or any of the others, for that factmatter. Nobody knows how to have restfun like a Le-Matoran!</i></p>
			<p>Overwhelmed with joy, Lewa shouted for attention. "Watch this, leafbrothers," he cried, balancing on the edge of the platform. "I'll show you the kind of sunsoaring I can do with my new powers!"</p>
			<p>He crouched briefly, then sprang up, putting all of his energy into the leap. Up, up, up...he soared higher into the sky above the treetops, higher and higher until he was almost blinded by the bright light of the sun.</p>
			<p>"Yeee-haaaa!" he cried as he reached the top of the arc.</p>
			<p>He waved his hand, calling upon the air currents to carry him down. As he did, he glanced down. He was a bit startled by how high he was.</p>
			<p>"Good thing my friend the wind is always there to do my bidding," Lewa murmured. Realizing the breeze he'd summoned hadn't yet materialized, he swirled his hand in the air again.</p>
			<p>Still the wind didn't respond.</p>
			<p>"What?" Lewa cried, his heart clenching with fear as he tried again-and again. He felt himself plummeting downward as he realized the truth-his elemental powers had deserted him.</p>
			<p>He tumbled helplessly down toward the village far-<i>too</i> far-below.</p>
			<h2>4. The Theft</h2>
			<p><i>"KRAAA!"</i></p>
			<p>Lewa's eyes flew open. He realized he had closed them to shut out the view of the hard ground rushing toward him. "Oof!" he cried as his descent was suddenly stopped just above the ground.</p>
			<p>For a second all he could see was a feathery neck. He clung to it, realizing he was still moving downward-but at a much safer speed.</p>
			<p>"Are you okay, Toa?" a breathless voice asked.</p>
			<p>"Kongu?" Lewa said. "Is that you?"</p>
			<p>"It's me and Ka," the Matoran responded. "It looked like you were in troublebad, so we upflew to check."</p>
			<p>"Thank you, bravebrother," Lewa said as he finally realized it was the beating wings and strong body of Ka the Gukko that had stopped his free fall. He glanced at Kongu, who was perched on the large bird's back. "I-I know not what wrong happened, but the wind didn't answer my herecall."</p>
			<p>With a squawk, Ka glided in for a landing, depositing Lewa on the swampy ground.</p>
			<p>"What do you mean, Toa?" Kongu asked. "How could the airwind not respond to you?"</p>
			<p>Lewa shook his head. "I don't know, little brother," he said. "It has not happened before."</p>
			<p>Not wanting to think about it anymore just then, he grabbed a vine and swung up into the village. Kongu followed aboard Ka.</p>
			<p>As he landed on the main platform, Lewa saw that the villagers were clustered together, their eyes and voices full of fear.</p>
			<p>"Don't worryfret, little ones," he called, assuming that they were concerned for his safety. "I'm all right."</p>
			<p>Matau rushed up to him, his eyes wild and frightened. "I'm gladhearted to hear that, Toa," he said. "But I'm afraid there is other wrongnews. Your power icon has been stolen!"</p>
			<p>"This creature," Onua Nuva said patiently, "what did it look like?"</p>
			<p>The Onu-Matoran standing before him, a sturdy villager named Onepu, bowed his head. "It was large," he reported. "But I was prepared to fight it."</p>
			<p>Onua nodded. "Go on."</p>
			<p>"I-I know not how else to describe it," Onepu said, his voice shaking slightly. "It was hideous-terrifying. Its body had a metallic sheen, and its claws were huge. I shouted for help, knowing I could not hold it off for long on my own. Then it-it spoke to me."</p>
			<p>He was silent for a long moment. Onua waited, gathering his patience.</p>
			<p>Finally Onepu continued. "Its words were as metallic and cold as its body," he said, his voice twisted with horror. "It told me to step aside so that it might claim its prize. When I would not, it-it began to breathe in. Within seconds, it had sucked away all of the air within the suva. I tried to hold my post, but with no air I found myself helpless. It pushed past me and grabbed the icon-and then it was gone."</p>
			<p>Onua turned the story over and over in his mind. Who was this new, mysterious enemy with such strange and disturbing powers? What did it want with Onua's power symbol?</p>
			<p>"What does it mean, Toa?" Onepu asked meekly. "Why did it happen?"</p>
			<p>"I thought these icons were merely that-symbols of we Toa's elemental powers, artistic tributes to our destiny," Onua said slowly, allowing the careful logic of his thoughts to unfold aloud. "But now I see that the icons actually held these powers within them. As long as my icon remained in the village, my power remained strong. Now that the symbol is gone, so are my powers."</p>
			<p>It was an uncomfortable feeling. Onua was accustomed to being the strongest of the strong. Now he was left helpless-and it seemed that a powerful new enemy had appeared on Mata Nui.</p>
			<p><i>Just when we thought Makuta's forces were stamped out for good...</i> Onua thought. He recalled Gali's words earlier that day. As usual, she had been right-she had been the only one with the wisdom to realize that Makuta would not be finished with them yet.</p>
			<p>"What should we do now?" Onepu asked. "Should I call out the Ussal forces and go after the thief?"</p>
			<p>"Not just yet," Onua said. "Go tell the Turaga what has happened. I'd better check in with the other Toa Nuva. Together we will decide what to do."</p>
			<h2>5. The Chase</h2>
			<p>Kopaka Nuva glided slowly down the snowy slope, reminding himself to be careful. While he could still ski, he no longer had the ability to control the ice beneath his feet. That skill had deserted him along with all the rest of them.</p>
			<p><i>It's beginning to seem that Gali's earlier worries were well-founded,</i> he thought bleakly. <i>Our split seemed almost too easy this time. As if it were destined to happen-or as if someone or something wanted it to happen.</i></p>
			<p>He still couldn't believe that his elemental powers had suddenly deserted him. It was only thanks to his determination-and the help of Turaga Nuju-that he had survived his sudden tumble off of a crumbling ice bridge.</p>
			<p>As soon as he heard that the Ice Toa's powers were gone, the Turaga had suggested that Kopaka seek out the others. If it had happened to all of them...Well, there was no telling what might become of Mata Nui in that case.</p>
			<p>Before long Kopaka left the snow behind and climbed down to the Toa's usual meeting place. To his relief, both Pohatu Nuva and Tahu Nuva were waiting for him in the clearing.</p>
			<p>"I guess this means the icon thief has struck in Ko-Koro, too, ice brother," Pohatu said by way of greeting.</p>
			<p>Kopaka nodded.</p>
			<p>"Whoever or whatever this foe may be, it will regret stealing our powers!" Tahu raged. "I will make sure of that!" He raised his magma sword for emphasis. Instead of its usual flickering flame, the sword merely smoked weakly.</p>
			<p>"Anger will not help us," Kopaka pointed out. "We need to unite, to form a plan."</p>
			<p>Tahu let out a short, disbelieving laugh. "Has the thief stolen my hearing as well?" he exclaimed. "I would swear I just heard Kopaka, the Toa of Doing His Own Thing, suggest that we unite!"</p>
			<p>"Brothers, brothers," Pohatu pleaded. "Enough with the petty disagreements. We have enough problems without that. Let's try to work together here, okay?"</p>
			<p>"Good advice at any time." Onua Nuva's voice interrupted the tense moment. He strode into the clearing and glanced around. "But especially important now, I think. All of you-you've lost your elemental powers, too?"</p>
			<p>Each Toa nodded. "I think it's safe to assume that Gali and Lewa will have been struck as well," Pohatu added.</p>
			<p>"You're right about that," Lewa said, hurrying into the clearing just in time to respond. "Found that out in a wrongmoment back in Le-Koro."</p>
			<p>Onua nodded. "Then we need to decide what to do."</p>
			<p>"I know what to do," Tahu spoke up at once. "Find the thief and take the symbols back. End of plan."</p>
			<p>Kopaka sighed. Typical Tahu-all bluster with no thought. "That's no plan," he said icily. "That's suicide."</p>
			<p>"Kopaka is right," Pohatu agreed. "Without our powers, and knowing not what we might be facing, it would be foolish to rush into action."</p>
			<p>"Who are you calling foolish?" Tahu snapped, glaring from Pohatu to Kopaka and back again.</p>
			<p>Onua raised his hand. "Easy, brother Tahu," he said. "Let's just think on this for a moment."</p>
			<p>Lewa rolled his eyes behind his mask. "Yes, a moment," he quipped. "Or a day, or a month. With all due respect, brother Onua, if we spent as much time wait-thinking as you would like, we'd never get anything done at all."</p>
			<p>Kopaka winced as Onua frowned. Lewa often spoke without thinking, but rarely did he purposely insult anyone. It was clear that the loss of powers was setting all of them on edge. <i>Where is sister Gali?</i> he wondered. <i>She's usually the only one who can make peace at such a moment.</i></p>
			<p>As if responding to his thought, Gali raced into the clearing at that very moment. "Brothers!" she cried breathlessly. "Good, you're all here. I have news!"</p>
			<p>"We know," Pohatu said. "Symbol stolen, powers gone, blah blah blah. Old news."</p>
			<p>Gali shook her head. "Not that," she said. "I already heard from a messenger that the thief struck all of us. Or, rather, the <i>thieves.</i>"</p>
			<p>"There is more than one creature stealing our powers?" Onua asked.</p>
			<p>"Yes," Gali replied, leaning on her aqua ax for support as she caught her breath. "My village guards were as helpless as yours before the intruder-it disabled them by filling the suva with electricity that pinned them to the walls. But others saw what happened and followed-and tracked it to the edge of Po-Wahi, where they saw it join with two others like it."</p>
			<p>"What are we waiting for?" Tahu hoisted his sword. "Let's get to Po-Wahi!"</p>
			<p>"Wait!" Onua cried. But Tahu had already charged off, with Lewa right behind him. Even Pohatu trotted after them eagerly.</p>
			<p>"Reckless fools," Kopaka muttered.</p>
			<p>Gali glanced at him. "I agree, some of our brothers could stand to do a little more thinking before they act," she said. "But this time, their course might be the best one. The longer we are without our powers, the greater the danger to Mata Nui. We have to confront these creatures and take back our icons."</p>
			<p>"I suppose you are right, sister," Onua said, his voice deep with worry. "But how easy will it be to do so without our powers?"</p>
			<p>Kopaka was wondering the same thing. But he followed without another word as Gali and Onua hurried after the others.</p>
			<p>Soon the six Toa Nuva were moving as a group through the open, rocky pass between the northern section of Le-Wahi and the eastern slopes of Mount Ihu.</p>
			<p>"We should at least try to be prepared for what we will face when we find the thieves," Onua pointed out as he hurried along near the back of the group. "The least we can do is share what information we have. What did your Matoran see? What tools did the creatures use against them?"</p>
			<p>Each Toa Nuva described everything he or she knew in turn. Tahu reported that the creature in his village had disabled the guards with a wall of intense sound so loud that it had cracked the walls of the suva. The creature that had stolen Lewa's icon had used a strong magnetic force to push away the Le-Matoran. In Onua's village, the weapon of choice had been a vacuum power that had sucked all of the air out of the suva. Pohatu had lost his symbol to a creature that had thrown off such intense heat that everything around it turned instantly to plasma. And Gali had already mentioned the electricity used against her villagers.</p>
			<p>When his turn came, Kopaka briefly described the way one of the creatures had affected gravity, making the Ko-Matoran guard's limbs and body too heavy to move. "It sounds like there may be six separate attackers, not three," he finished. "Six enemies, and six of us."</p>
			<p>"Three or six, three dozen or six hundred, it matters not," Tahu said with a shrug. "We must face them down no matter what."</p>
			<p>With that, he hurried forward to the end of the pass. Beyond lay the open, sweeping vista of the great northern desert.</p>
			<p>"Now which waypath do we take?" Lewa wondered.</p>
			<p>Onua pointed. "I would say we go that way."</p>
			<p>Kopaka followed the Earth Toa's glance and saw broad prints leading northward in the bare soil. The marks were large and deep.</p>
			<p>"Come on!" Tahu said. "Are we going to stand around looking at these tracks, or are we going to follow them and take back what is ours?"</p>
			<p>Without waiting for an answer, he strode off in the direction the tracks led.</p>
			<p>"Our enemies seem to be making no attempt to remain stealthy," Pohatu commented. "I wonder if we should be worried by that."</p>
			<p>"They should be worried about us!" Tahu said boldly. He led the way over a rise. Beyond lay a large, rocky plain scattered with stones of all shapes and sizes.</p>
			<p>"Does anyone see prints?" Gali asked.</p>
			<p>Pohatu shook his head. "It will be pointless trying to find them here," he said. "This sort of ground is not friendly to ordinary tracking."</p>
			<p>"Maybe we should go back," Onua said. "We could seek out the rest of the Kanohi Nuva-with those additional powers, it may be easier to find the thieves."</p>
			<p>"We've got to continue on." Tahu seemed unwilling to accept reality. "If we search Po-Wahi, we have to catch up to them."</p>
			<p>"Or maybe not, if they've pathchanged to the tunnels of Onu-Wahi or anywhere else." Lewa shrugged. "Besides, what do we do if we find them?"</p>
			<p>Kopaka grimaced. Where had that question been when they were all back at the meeting place?</p>
			<p>"It's not 'if'," Tahu said, breaking into Kopaka's thoughts. "We <i>will</i> find them, and we <i>will</i> get our powers back."</p>
			<p>Pohatu was still staring across the rocky plain. Now he raised his hand and pointed. "Uh, Tahu?" he said. "I think those things up ahead might have something to say about it."</p>
			<h2>6. Helpless</h2>
			<p>Pohatu stared as the six creatures he had spotted came closer. Their bodies were sinewy and powerful-looking, covered in gleaming metallic armor of various shades-red, blue, silver, bronze, green, and black.</p>
			<p>"What <i>are</i> those things?" Onua murmured.</p>
			<p>"They look sort of like Bohrok," Pohatu said. "Only meaner."</p>
			<p>Gali grimaced. "Let's just hope there aren't swarms of them somewhere," she commented. "These six look to be enough to deal with."</p>
			<p>"And deal with them we will," Tahu said grimly, tightening his grip on his magma sword.</p>
			<p>By then the creatures had nearly reached the Toa Nuva. One of them, the one with the reddish-colored armor, stepped forward.</p>
			<p>"We are the Bohrok-Kal," it announced in a hard, smooth voice. "We search for Cahdok and Gahdok, queens of the swarms."</p>
			<p>Pohatu's eyes widened in surprise. The queens? So he had been right-these must be a strange sort of Bohrok. The original swarms had been controlled by the queens. But these creatures seemed to function all on their own.</p>
			<p>"Tell us where you have hidden the Bahrag, and then stand aside. We have no wish to harm helpless foes."</p>
			<p>"Helpless?" Lewa exclaimed, charging forward. "Toa Nuva are never helpless!"</p>
			<p>The Bohrok-Kal raised its greenish metal shield. "No amount of speed can save you from my magnetic force," it said coldly as a wave of power rippled out from the shield's surface.</p>
			<p>Lewa was stopped in place so quickly that he nearly toppled over. "My feet!" Lewa cried. "Magnetized to the ground! I can't move!"</p>
			<p>Onua grabbed an enormous boulder and lifted it above his head. Even without his elemental powers, his strength remained awesome.</p>
			<p>Before he could throw the boulder, another Bohrok-Kal lifted its shield and sent a wave of concentrated power toward it. "Your rock is no threat, Toa Nuva," the creature said as the boulder dissolved into magma. "And neither are you. Give us Cahdok and Gahdok-now!"</p>
			<p>Tahu leaped toward Gali, Pohatu, and Kopaka. His mask was glowing brightly.</p>
			<p>"The Mask of Shielding will protect us for now," Tahu said as his mask's force field surrounded himself and the other three Toa. "Bohrok-Kal, your quest must fail-the creatures you seek have vanished from Mata Nui."</p>
			<p>"You lie!" the black Bohrok-Kal hissed. "They are here and we will find them. Your shield cannot stand before the crushing power of gravity, Tahu Nuva."</p>
			<p>A second later Tahu hit the ground hard. Gali gasped as she saw him struggling to lift his sword. His weight, multiplied a hundredfold by the Bohrok-Kal's gravity power, crushed the stones beneath it as he sank into the ground.</p>
			<p>"Tahu!" Gali cried, horrified to see the bold and powerful Fire Toa made so helpless.</p>
			<p>"The shield is down," Kopaka said grimly. "Defend yourselves, Toa Nuva!"</p>
			<p>"There can be no defense against Tahnok-Kal's electricity," the reddish Bohrok-Kal said.</p>
			<p>"Or Kohrak-Kal's sonic power," the silvery one hissed.</p>
			<p>"And Lehvak-Kal's vacuum blast," the greenish creature added.</p>
			<p>Gali gulped. A second later, she felt herself flung backward by a blast of combined energy so strong that she could hardly tell where one force ended and the next began. Air, electricity, sound-all surrounded and overwhelmed her, filling her mind and body so that, for a long moment, they seemed to cease to exist.</p>
			<h2>7. The Search</h2>
			<p>Tahu opened his eyes and sat up, unsure how much time had passed. There was no sign of the Bohrok-Kal anywhere.</p>
			<p>Beside him, Lewa began to stir. "Ugh," he said blearily. "What happened?"</p>
			<p>"I believe we hae just been given a warning by the Bohrok-Kal," Onua said heavily, pushing himself upright. "They obviously do not want us interfering with their search."</p>
			<p>Tahu scowled. "No?" he cried, jumping to his feet. "Well, the Bohrok-Kal will pay for daring to challenge the Toa Nuva. We shall-"</p>
			<p>"Tahu!" Gali cut him off. By this time all six Toa were awake, sitting up and testing their limbs for injury. "This is no time to worry about our pride. If they find Cahdok and Gahdok and free them, the Bohrok swarms will strike again!"</p>
			<p>"But how do we stop them?" Pohatu sounded worried. "Our powers are gone."</p>
			<p>Tahu noticed that Lewa's eyes were clouded and his expression slightly pained. "What is it, brother?" he asked with concern. "Are you hurt?"</p>
			<p>Lewa shook his head. "No, it's not that," he said. "It's just..." His voice trailed off hesitantly.</p>
			<p>"What?" Tahu asked sharply, not liking the look in Lewa's eyes. It reminded him of the way the Air Toa had looked after being taken over by the Bohrok swarms. "Tell us what's wrong." It was an order, not a suggestion.</p>
			<p>"Fine, fine," Lewa said. "Don't get your swords in a muddletwist. I-I could be dreamthinking it from the blow. But I thought I heard something. From the Bohrok-Kal."</p>
			<p>"Heard something?" Gali repeated with interest. "What do you mean?"</p>
			<p>Lewa shrugged. "Communication. Thought-talk," he said. "Like that of the krana."</p>
			<p>Pohatu blinked in surprise. "Are you saying there are krana inside these Bohrok-Kal, controlling them, just as there were in the Bohrok?"</p>
			<p>"That would make sense," Kopaka pointed out. "These Bohrok-Kal seem to be related to the Bohrok somehow. They share the same goal."</p>
			<p>"Not exactly," Gali said. "After all, Bohrok-Kal don't seem interested in damaging anything. They left the villages untouched."</p>
			<p>"They're trying to frighten us," Lewa said. "To make us run so we won't try to stop them."</p>
			<p>Kopaka scowled. "No one makes me run," he said coldly. "No one."</p>
			<p>For once, Tahu agreed with the Ice Toa. "Enough talk," he said. "Gali, you, Pohatu, and Onua go back to the Bohrok nest-see if you can discover what happened to Cahdok and Gahdok. Kopaka, Lewa, and I will keep after the Bohrok-Kal-see if we can slow them down."</p>
			<p>I suggest we all keep our eyes out for Kanohi Nuva masks," Onua said as he joined Gali and Pohatu. "With our elemental energies gone, we need all the help we can get."</p>
			<p>	*	*	*</p>
			<p>Onua was troubled as he followed Gali and Pohatu, heading for the entrance to the Bahrag's nest. <i>How are we supposed to do it?</i> he thought uneasily. <i>How are we supposed to fulfill our destiny to protect Mata Nui when our greatest powers have been taken from us?</i></p>
			<p>Gali glanced over her shoulder at him. "This is a momentous challenge that we face, brother," she commented. "Perhaps the greatest test yet of our resolve."</p>
			<p>Shading his eyes against the glare of the sun, Onua smiled at her. He had often noticed that the Toa of Water could all but read others' thoughts at times.</p>
			<p>"Yes," he agreed. "It will not be easy. But we cannot falter. All of Mata Nui depends on us."</p>
			<p>"The weakness this time may lie in the krana-kal," Gali pointed out. "They could be controlling the Bohrok-Kal just as the krana controlled the regular swarms."</p>
			<p>Onua nodded. "I was thinking about that, too," he said. "I hope brother Lewa is right about hearing krana voices. It could be our only hope."</p>
			<p>"I suppose so," Pohatu said. "If we can figure out a way to separate the krana-kal from the Bohrok-Kal, we just might-"</p>
			<p>"Hush," Onua broke in, picking up a sound from somewhere up ahead.</p>
			<p>A second later, something large and fast-moving crashed into sight from around a bend in the riverbed. It was the reddish-colored Bohrok-Kal, the one known as the Tahnok-Kal.</p>
			<p>"Stand aside, Toa Nuva," it hissed loudly as it came. "You are in my way."</p>
			<p>"We will not," Pohatu said boldly. "If you want to go this way, you'll have to go through us."</p>
			<p>Onua stepped up beside him, as did Gali. The Tahnok-Kal didn't slow its pace. It merely raised its shield, sending several lightning bolts shooting out of it.</p>
			<p>"Look out!" Gali shouted, but it was too late. The bolts hit the ground beneath Onua, flinging him into the air, where he tumbled over and over before landing with a heavy thud on the bank of the dry river.</p>
			<p>"Oof!" Pohatu grunted as he landed beside him a second later. Nearby, Gali dropped heavily onto the hard-packed ground as well.</p>
			<p>Onua blinked, trying to clear his mind. Pushing himself upright, he looked down into the riverbed just in time to see the Tahnok-Kal hurrying on without a backward glance.</p>
			<p>The Toa of Earth squinted, willing his sun-weakened eyes to focus. "Look," he croaked, pointing. "Is that...?"</p>
			<p>The other two followed his gaze. Gali gasped. "A krana-kal!" she said. "The creature carries it beneath its face shield. So Lewa <i>was</i> right!"</p>
			<p>Pohatu stared after the Tahnok-Kal as it disappeared around a bend. "That thing," he said, sounding shaken. "It didn't even slow down! It just knocked us aside and kept going."</p>
			<p>Gali climbed to her feet. "Come on, brothers," she said wearily. "The only good news is that the Tahnok-Kal was heading away from the tunnel entrance. We'd better take advantage and get there before it does."</p>
			<p>Soon the three of them were hurrying up a rocky slope. At the top, Onua knew they would find the entrance, buried under a giant pile of rocks. After their battle with the Bohrok queens, an avalanche had completely covered the opening.</p>
			<p>Pohatu was already moving forward toward the pile of rocks. He drew back one foot and kicked at a large boulder.</p>
			<p>"Ow!" he shouted as his foot connected with the solid stone. The boulder didn't budge.</p>
			<p>"Pohatu, don't," Gali said gently. "Without your powers, you'll only wear yourself out."</p>
			<p>Onua sighed. "We're going to have to find a different way," he said.</p>
			<p>Gali stared at the covered cave entrance. "I'm starting to think that seeking out the Bahrag ourselves is a waste of time," she said. "It's unlikely we would be able to stop the Bohrok-Kal from getting to them anyway. I think we should focus on finding a way to get those krana-kal. Without them, the Bohrok-Kal will most likely be left directionless-and harmless."</p>
			<p>"I agree," Onua said. "We need to get those krana-kal-any way we can."</p>
			<h2>8. The Soundshape</h2>
			<p>"Easy, easy," Lewa Nuva murmured under his breath. "Don't look uptree, my metallic friend. Nothing to see up here..."</p>
			<p>He carefully swung across a clearing on a vine, his gaze trained on the Kohrak-Kal, which was marching along the ground below. The creature seemed unaware of the Toa Nuva's presence.</p>
			<p>He hadn't kept track of how much time had passed since that first meeting with the Bohrok-Kal, but it seemed like forever. The Toa had split up, trying to get the Krana-Kal. But every encounter had ended the same way-with the Toa Nuva groaning on the ground while the Bohrok-Kal continued on their quest without so much as a pause.</p>
			<p><i>At least we found a fewnumber of Kanohi masks along the way,</i> Lewa thought, trying to look on the bright side. <i>So we each have some of our maskpowers back now.</i></p>
			<p>Below, the Kohrak-Kal moved on. <i>Just a few farthersteps,</i> Lewa thought, willing himself to be patient. <i>It's almost time.</i></p>
			<p>He grasped a strong vine hanging nearby, glancing up to make sure that it was firmly entwined around a higher branch.</p>
			<p>When the creature was near the middle of the clearing, Lewa nodded. It was time.</p>
			<p>He bent his knees and pushed off, springing gracefully off the tree branch. Holding the vine tightly with one hand, he held the other outstretched at the ready. The vine swung him down, down, down-as the vine's arc reached the clearing, he was skimming just above the swampy ground.</p>
			<p><i>Perfect!</i> he thought eagerly, aiming straight toward the Kohrak-Kal. The creature's broad back was to him, and Lewa could clearly see the softly glowing white krana-kal set into the center of it. He was almost close enough to grab it...</p>
			<p><i>WHANNNNNNNNNG!</i></p>
			<p>A burst of noise exploded out of the Kohrak-Kal just as Lewa reached it, knocking him to the ground as solidly as any physical strike might do. Lewa was momentarily stunned by the blow, but quickly leaped to his feet. The Kohrak-Kal hardly spared him a glance as it continued easily on its way, but it did gesture briefly in his direction with its shield. A split second later, a high wall of solid sound sprang up between it and the Toa Nuva-vibrating and whining, sending leaves scattering away and causing tree trunks at the edge of the clearing to bend and crack.</p>
			<p>"You won't awayblock the Toa of Air so easily," Lewa muttered, though is words were lost in the cacophony. Taking a deep breath, he called upon the power of the Mask of Levitation. He floated upward, easily reaching the top of the wall.</p>
			<p>As soon as he did, the sonic waves shifted slightly, moving out and around him and blocking his rise. The wall of sound surrounded him, pummeling him with its intensity, so loud that it seemed it would crack the earth and sky themselves.</p>
			<p>Lewa dropped back to the ground, hardly noticing the force of the fall. Much worse was the force of sound assaulting his ears-staggering, inconceivable sound. How could any creature hold such terrible power?</p>
			<p>Lewa couldn't think, couldn't move-could do nothing but try to survive the assault.</p>
			<p>It was unbearable-like nothing he had ever experienced, like nothing he could ever have imagined. It bent his mind until it could think no more, his body until it could stand against it no more.</p>
			<p>"Kopaka!" Gali's voice was urgent. "Come here-quick!"</p>
			<p>Kopaka abandoned the Bohrok-Kal footprint he was examining and hurried forward to join Gali, who had moved several lengths ahead through the jungle.</p>
			<p>"The soundshape...the soundshape..." Lewa was muttering, his gaze blank and his limbs curled into a fetal position.</p>
			<p>"Lewa!" Kopaka said sharply. "Brother Lewa, do you hear me?"</p>
			<p>"He's in shock," Gali said, kneeling beside the Toa of Air. "Give him a moment."</p>
			<p>Kopaka nodded, watching as Lewa writhed on the ground. Mud and swampy water covered him, making it clear that he'd been there quite a while. What could have happened to him?</p>
			<p><i>The Bohrok-Kal, of course,</i> Kopaka told himself grimly. <i>Our foolish airheaded brother must have decided to try to take one on by himself. Hasn't he learned his lesson by now?</i></p>
			<p>Kopaka noticed that the Toa of Air was pressing his hands to his ears. "Look at that," he told Gali. "He must have tangled with the sonic shield of the Kohrak-Kal."</p>
			<p>"Yes," Gali agreed with a shudder. "Tht one is worse than all the others combined, if you ask me."</p>
			<p>She reached down and gently tried to pry one of Lewa's hands loose. He struggled briefly against her, then finally relaxed. Slowly, his sightless eyes began to focus.</p>
			<p>Finally he groaned and sat up. "Ice brother, water sister," he croaked weakly. "The sound-it's really gone?"</p>
			<p>"Whatever happened, it's over," Gali assured him. "You're safe now."</p>
			<p>Kopaka stretched out a hand to help Lewa to his feet. "What happened, brother?" he asked.</p>
			<p>Lewa winced. "Please, Kopaka," he said. "Keep your voice quietlow. My ears are still ringing from the boxing the Kohrak-Kal gave them."</p>
			<p>"So it was the Kohrak-Kal," Kopaka said, carefully keeping his voice to little more than a whisper. "Why did it come after you?"</p>
			<p>"It didn't, exactly," Lewa admitted, his own voice gaining strength with each passing moment. "It was defending its krana-kal-I had hoped to vineswing down and grab it from above. I thought I was trackfollowing undetected, but I guess it knew I was there after all."</p>
			<p>"That was a risky plan, brother," Gali chided him gently.</p>
			<p>Kopaka grimaced, his own opinion of Lewa's plan formed of harsher words. But he shrugged them off. Lewa had learned his lesson the hard way.</p>
			<p>"What do we do now?" he asked instead. "The more we see of this enemy, the stronger it seems."</p>
			<p>"Evertrue, brother," Lewa agreed. "If those swarmqueens are still down there in the darktunnels somewhere, it's only a matter of time until the Bohrok-Kal trackfind them."</p>
			<p>Kopaka glanced at him, surprised at the normally cheerful Toa Nuva's pessimistic words. "We can't give up," he reminded him. "No matter what, we have to do all we can to protect Mata Nui. It is our destiny."</p>
			<p>"I know that everwell, coldbrother," Lewa retorted. "But how does it helpsave Mata Nui to let ourselves be crushed by the Bohrok-Kal? We have tried manyplans, yet nothing can stop them."</p>
			<p>Gali cleared her throat. "Wait, brothers," she said quietly. "Ther is one thing we haven't tried yet..."</p>
			<h2>9. The Agony of Defeat</h2>
			<p>"This time I won't stop until I have your krana-kal, monster!" Tahu shouted as he landed atop a ridge just three lengths from the Pahrak-Kal.</p>
			<p>The creature paused and glanced back toward him. Then it turned away, its bronze-shaded krana-kal seeming to mock him.</p>
			<p>"Don't turn your back on me, Pahrak-Kal!" Tahu howled, raising his magma sword and charging after the creature. "I've come for a fight, and a fight I will have!"</p>
			<p>The creature merely raised its shield, deflecting Tahu's blows easily. Then it pointed the shield toward the ground. Seconds later, the hardened and cooled magma had melted into a boiling puddle of fresh lava.</p>
			<p>Tahu felt himself sinking into the newly created lava puddle. To his surprise, he could feel the burning sensation of the boiling lava on his feet and legs. He leaped backward, landing on the solid ground behind him. Steam rose from his feet.</p>
			<p><i>Uh-oh,</i> he thought in horror. <i>I didn't realize that my ability to withstand intense heat had deserted me along with my other elemental powers.</i></p>
			<p>"Are you through with me yet, oh, great Toa?" the Pahrak-Kal taunted.</p>
			<p>The creature's scornful tone only fanned the flames of Tahu's anger. "Believe me, when I'm through with you, you won't have to ask."</p>
			<p>This time the Pahrak-Kal took a step toward him as it raised its shield. The wave of heat that rippled out from the shield surrounded Tahu, filling his body with searing fire.</p>
			<p>Tahu realized all he had to do was fall back again and the heat would stop. All he had to do was retreat. But he couldn't-that would mean letting the Pahrak-Kal win. Giving up.</p>
			<p><i>So this monster wants to fight me with my own element?</i> he thought as the fire filled his body, seeming to burn him up from the inside out. <i>Fine, then let it do its worst. Better to burn out than to give up...</i></p>
			<p>"Toa Tahu!" a voice shouted from somewhere nearby. Distracted, the Pahrak-Kal turned, at the same time shifting the aim of its shield. Tahu slumped to the ground, gasping at the sudden disappearance of the pain.</p>
			<p>As he collapsed, he glanced up and saw Jaller, the head of the Ta-Koronan guard. Several other Ta-Matoran stood up behind him. The Pahrak-Kal watched the newcomers approach.</p>
			<p>"Is this your rescue party, Toa?" it hissed with amusement. "They're a little on the puny side."</p>
			<p>"Leave us alone, creature!" Jaller shouted boldly.</p>
			<p>The Pahrak-Kal gazed at the Matoran. "I have no quarrel with any of you, weak ones," it said. "Your hotheaded Toa is the one who wished to test my powers."</p>
			<p>With that it turned and moved on along the ridge. Tahu pushed himself to a sitting position as Jaller kneeled beside him.</p>
			<p>"Are you all right, Toa Tahu?" the Matoran asked with concern.</p>
			<p>Tahu pushed aside his helping hand. "I'm fine," he said brusquely, climbing to his feet. "And I'll be even better once I take care of that thing."</p>
			<p>"Toa!" Jaller cried, grabbing his arm. "Please, stop! You'll get yourself hurt!"</p>
			<p>"Better that than living as a coward," Tahu snapped, shaking off the Matoran's grip.</p>
			<p>"You have no right!" Jaller shouted, anger in his voice.</p>
			<p>Tahu stopped short, blinking in surprise. Slowly, he turned to face the Matoran. Jaller's eyes behind their mask were defiant.</p>
			<p>"What did you say to me?" Tahu asked, holding down his rage with difficulty.</p>
			<p>Jaller took a deep breath. "I said, you have no right," he said. "You have no right to sacrifice yourself. You have a duty to us-to Mata Nui. Your destiny doesn't allow room for personal pride."</p>
			<p>Tahu couldn't help being impressed by the Matoran's courage in speaking out so boldly. <i>Of course, it seems like just about everyone is taking things into their own hands lately,</i> he thought with a flash of annoyance. He had been unpleasantly surprised when he'd first heard that Onua had decided to change plans without consulting him. For a moment he had started to insist on doing things his way-just to make sure that everyone knew who was in charge. But Gali and Pohatu convinced him that the Earth Toa's decision was right. Was Jaller right in his defiance, too?</p>
			<p>Out of the corner of his eye, he noticed that the Pahrak-Kal had paused again and seemed to be listening. It took a step back toward them.</p>
			<p>"Listen to your little friend, Toa," it hissed with a chuckle. "He's only trying to save you from being humbled by the strength of the Bohrok-Kal. Again."</p>
			<p>Tahu gritted his teeth. "Mark my words, Pahrak-Kal," he said slowly, calling upon every ounce of strength he had to control the flames of his temper. "You will not succeed in your mission. For it is the sworn duty of the Toa Nuva to stop you. And stop you we will."</p>
			<p>The Pahrak-Kal laughed, the sound tinny and scornful. "Is that so, feeble hero?" it said. "Once we find and release the queens, you will-<i>aaaagh!</i>"</p>
			<p>Its words broke off in a strangled cry. To his surprise, Tahu saw that Jaller had just leaped forward and wrenched the krana-kal free!</p>
			<p>The Pahrak-Kal's limbs twitched, it let out several moans, and then fell still.</p>
			<p>"Good job, brave Jaller!" Tahu cried with delight. "Now that we've conquered one of them, the others will-"</p>
			<p>"Toa Tahu-look!" Another Matoran broke in, pointing to the far end of the ridge.</p>
			<p>A Gahlok Va was scuttling toward them. "What's it doing?" Tahu wondered aloud.</p>
			<p>He didn't have to wait long for the answer. As the small scout creature came closer, he saw that it was clutching something in its clawed hand.</p>
			<p>"Is it-is it bringing the creature another krana-kal?" Jaller asked in surprised dismay.</p>
			<p>Tahu nodded grimly. "Looks that way."</p>
			<p>"Everybody run!" one of the Matoran cried out.</p>
			<p><i>So much for our alliance with the Bohrok and Bohrok Va,</i> Tahu thought hopelessly as he and the Matoran scattered at top speed. <i>It seems the Bohrok-Kal are exerting some kind of influence over them. It seems we may have made a serious mistake in trusting the swarms inside our villages...</i></p>
			<p>For a moment, he thought of the Kanohi Vahi. Was this the desperate emergency Vakama had spoken of? Was it time to call upon the dreadful powers of the Great Mask of Time?</p>
			<p>He shook his head, feeling helpless and angry as he ran. He could barely control his own temper. Why had Vakama asked him to control such an awesome power?</p>
			<p>In the jungle near Le-Koro, Gali was primed for battle. "Ready?" she asked.</p>
			<p>Kopaka nodded. "Ready."</p>
			<p>"Me, too," Lewa added. "Let's do this."</p>
			<p>Gali closed her eyes, gathering and focusing her energy. She concentrated on the other two Toa Nuva, allowing her own mind to flow and merge with theirs...</p>
			<p>A moment later, the Toa Nuva Kaita known as Wairuha opened his eyes. Created from the mental and physical uniting of the three Toa, he combined their powers into one form.</p>
			<p>"It is time to put an end to this threat," he rumbled, moving toward the Lehvak-Kal that was searching a boggy area nearby.</p>
			<p>The Lehvak-Kal stopped what it was doing. "So this is how it will be, Kaita? Then so be it."</p>
			<p>As Wairuha moved toward it, the creature let out a series of shrill calls. Seconds later, two more Bohrok-Kal appeared-the Kohrak-Kal and the Gahlok-Kal.</p>
			<p>Wairuha gathered his powers. To his surprise, the creatures ignored him and turned instead toward one another. There was a blast of energy-and all of a sudden a single, larger creature stood where three had been a second before!</p>
			<p>Wairuha gasped. The Bohrok-Kal had merged into their own Kaita being!</p>
			<p>The creature attacked, flinging a solid mass of flickering sound toward him. Wairuha ducked, but it was too late.</p>
			<p>The orb caught him and trapped him within an airless, magnetized vortex of sound. Every part of his body was pulled toward every other part by the intense magnetic field, while his mouth gasped for air and his mind shrieked against the pummeling scream of sound.</p>
			<p><i>No,</i> Wairuha thought, struggling to retain consciousness. <i>Must-fight-against-</i></p>
			<p>"Oof!" Kopaka grunted as he hit the ground a second later, flung out of the unity by the force of the attack.</p>
			<p>Nearby, the Bohrok-Kal Kaita dissolved its own merging, returning to three separate forms. "That was almost-fun," the Lehvak-Kal said with a metallic laugh.</p>
			<p>"Yes," the Kohrak-Kal responded. "But we must not think of that. We have to find the queens."</p>
			<p>The three creatures turned away from one another and, without further discussion, scuttled off in different directions.</p>
			<p>Kopaka watched them go as the strength slowly seeped back into his body. Finally he was able to lift his arms, testing them for injury. "That was <i>not</i> fun," he said succinctly.</p>
			<p>"Not even a little," Lewa agreed, his voice heavy. "If even the Toa Nuva Kaita can't stand against these creatures, what hope is there?"</p>
			<p>Kopaka had to agree with him. No matter how he looked at it, there seemed to be no solution. The Toa Nuva could not stop the Bohrok-Kal-they couldn't even slow them down.</p>
			<p><i>Is this the end?</i> he wondered hopelessly. <i>Is it our destiny to fall before this unstoppable enemy-to fail in our duty to protect Mata Nui?</i></p>
			<p>He glanced over at Gali, expecting her to protest against the Air Toa's pessimistic words.</p>
			<p>But Gali merely shook her head, her expression downcast. "I fear that at this point, all we can hope is that the creatures' search will turn out to be fruitless," she commented wearily. "That Cahdok and Gahdok really are gone for good as we had hoped."</p>
			<p>Kopaka nodded along with Lewa. But he had his doubts.</p>
			<p>In the depths of the earth far below, the waiting dark figure laughed, for he had sensed the Toa's words.</p>
			<p>"Giving up so soon, mighty heroes?" he cried with delight, though he knew the Toa could not hear him. "The endless tales and legends of the Turaga surely did not foresee this, did they? But I am not surprised. The Toa may be hailed as heroes, but they are as flawed as any Matoran. Flawed and weak and frightened before this more powerful enemy. And so their story seems to be reaching its end-at last."</p>
			<p>The figure glanced over at an enormous mask that stared sightlessly from the cavern wall nearby. He nodded thoughtfully as he gazed at it, his red eyes glowing more brightly than ever.</p>
			<p>"Fear not, brother," he said. "As long as I am here, nothing will ever disturb you..."</p>
			<h2>10. A New Hope</h2>
			<p>"Are you two going to tell me what this is about?" Tahu Nuva asked.</p>
			<p>Pohatu Nuva could tell that the Fire Toa was reaching the end of his meager store of patience. "Soon, brother," he said soothingly. "It will be easier to discuss it when we're all together."</p>
			<p>Onua, who was in the lead, glanced over his shoulder and nodded. "A Matoran told us he saw Gali, Lewa, and Kopaka here in the jungle. We should be with them shortly."</p>
			<p>Tahu sighed loudly, but didn't protest further. Pohatu was relieved. If what he and onua had just learned was true, the Toa Nuva had much more important things to do than bicker among themselves.</p>
			<p>Soon they heard voices through the trees, and a moment later the other three Toa Nuva emerged in a clearing. Gali spotted them first.</p>
			<p>"Brothers!" she called, hurrying toward them. "We were just talking about coming to find you. We've had a rather disturbing experience that we thought you should hear about."</p>
			<p>"You're not the only ones," Pohatu replied. "Wait until you hear what Onua and I found out."</p>
			<p>"Yes," Tahu said irritably. "I <i>have</i> been waiting for that. Too long."</p>
			<p>Onua nodded at Gali and the other two Toa Nuva who had just hurried up behind her. "Why don't you three go first?" he suggested.</p>
			<p>"Well, it all began with Gali's ideaplan," Lewa said. "See, she and Kopaka had just helpfound me after I had a tangle with the Kohrak-Kal, and-"</p>
			<p>"Why don't we try the short version of the story?" Kopaka interrupted. "We merged into Wairuha. Three Bohrok-Kal formed their own Kaita. They beat us."</p>
			<p>Lewa rolled his eyes. "Some storyteller you are," he muttered.</p>
			<p>Pohatu hardly heard him. He was too shocked by what Kopaka had just said. "The Toa Nuva Kaita," he exclaimed. "And it was no match for the Bohrok-Kal?"</p>
			<p>"Not even close," Gali admitted. "Its power-it was astonishing. It disunited us, leaving us helpless. Fortunately it seemed to have no interest in fighting us further and left-heading toward the north."</p>
			<p>"We might know why it went that way," Onua said heavily. "Come, let's walk that direction ourselves as we talk-you'll understand why in a moment. Pohatu, why don't you tell them what we learned?"</p>
			<p>Pohatu nodded. "With all due respect to brother Kopaka, I think I'll tell the medium-length version of the story," he said.</p>
			<p>He went on to describe how he and Onua had tracked the Tahnok-Kal to the beach on the eastern shore of the island. They had hidden in the woods nearby and concocted a plan to disable it by reflecting its lightning bolts back over its head toward a tall tree behind the creature. For once, the plan had worked perfectly, and the tree had cracked and fallen right on the Tahnok-Kal, trapping it. The two Toa Nuva had been able to remove the krana-kal from the creature with little trouble. "Then the krana-kal spoke to us," Pohatu continued. "It told us we were already too late-that the Bohrok-Kal had learned where Cahdok and Gahdok were trapped."</p>
			<p>Lewa gasped. "But we were so sure that the swarmqueens were no more," he exclaimed.</p>
			<p>"We mentioned that to the krana-kal," Onua said wryly. "It seemed quite convinced that we were wrong."</p>
			<p>Pohatu nodded. "The Bohrok swarms have left the villages where they were working. All of them seem to be heading back to their nest-as if obeying a command."</p>
			<p>Onua nodded. "If we're to have any hope of protecting Mata Nui, we've got to get there before them," he said. "That's why we're heading north-to Po-Wahi."</p>
			<p>By this time the group had reached the edge of the jungle. "So we're going back to the tunnel entrance?" Gali asked. "But we've already been there. The tunnel was filled in with rocks."</p>
			<p>"Yes, we know," Pohatu said. "But we have most of our Kanohi Nuva now. We might be able to push through somehow, or dig a shortcut into the lair. Just so long as we get down there before the Bohrok-Kal find their way underground."</p>
			<p>"What good will that do?" Lewa asked, vaulting over a low wall of tumbled stones. "Don't you think they can easywin belowground as well as above it?"</p>
			<p>Kopaka was looking thoughtful. "I know," he spoke up. "The Exo-Toa."</p>
			<p>"That's right," Pohatu said. "We don't have our powers, but the Exo-Toa armor will give us strength if we can reach them in time."</p>
			<p>The others nodded. They all remembered the giant suits of armor that they had encountered underground. The Exo-Toa armor had helped them trap Cahdok and Gahdok. the last they had seen it, it was still there near the Bahrag's lair.</p>
			<p>There was little conversation as the group continued across the plains and deserts of Po-Wahi, each deep in his or her own thoughts.</p>
			<p>Finally they reached the base of the hill leading to the cave entrance. "Almost there," Tahu commented. He led the way up the slope.</p>
			<p>A moment later all six Toa Nuva stopped short, staring in surprise at the sight before them. The huge pile of rocks that had covered the entrance the last time they'd seen it was gone-completely melted. The entrance yawned open, leading down into the darkness.</p>
			<h2>11. Tahu's Decision</h2>
			<p>Kopaka glanced toward the hole in the floor of the underground chamber. How long had it been since Lewa had levitated down through it?</p>
			<p>To distract himself, he looked around the underground chamber. It hadn't changed much since the last time he had seen it, just after the defeat of the Bahrag. The only real difference was the jagged hole burned into the floor.</p>
			<p>Onua was standing near the hole, his head tipped to one side. "Do you hear something?"</p>
			<p>Gali smiled. "None of us have the sensitive hearing you do, brother," she reminded him. "What do you hear?"</p>
			<p>"I'm not sure." Onua frowned, leaning closer to the hole. "Strange, faraway sounds-like shattering glass or stone. I hope Lewa is okay. Maybe we shouldn't have let him go down alone."</p>
			<p>"He is the best of all of us at moving quickly and silently," Pohatu reminded him. "Anyway, if he doesn't return soon, we can-"</p>
			<p>"Everbad sightnews!" Lewa said, popping up out of the hole so suddenly that the waiting Toa Nuva all jumped in surprise. He sounded breathless, and his eyes were wide and worried. "The Bohrok-Kal are downcave, all right. They're groupstanding cubefront with their iconloot, and the hardluck Exo-Toa is downfalling everquick, and-"</p>
			<p>"Wait!" Onua cut him off. "Brother, slow down. What are you telling us?"</p>
			<p>Lewa took a deep breath. "Truesorry," he said. "It's just that what I saw was so scarybad. The Exo-Toa-they were watchguarding the Bahrag's prison. By themselves."</p>
			<p>Kopaka blinked in surprise. The suits of armor-they could act on their own?</p>
			<p>"Are you sure?" he asked Lewa.</p>
			<p>"Truesure," Lewa replied. "They were fighting against the Bohrok-Kal-but having sorrybad luck at it. I saw the creatures destroy most of the Exo-Toa before I hurryleft to come back."</p>
			<p>Gali's eyes were somber. "I see," she said. "What was that you said about a cube?"</p>
			<p>"Oh!" Lewa said quickly. "There was a cube-a lightglowing, airhovering thing. It was in front of the darkcavern. I couldn't see what was inside the cavern. But I can dreadguess."</p>
			<p>"Cahdok and Gahdok," Pohatu said solemnly, voicing what all were thinking.</p>
			<p>Lewa nodded. "The cube had shapecarved spaces on each side," he said. "A perfect fit for the power symbols that were stolen from us."</p>
			<p>"That must be why the Bohrok-Kal wanted the icons," Onua said, his eyes lighting up with realization. "They must need to fit them into that cube in order to release the Bahrag-it's like a lock of some kind."</p>
			<p>"This is bad," Kopaka said. "We'd better get down there and do whatever we can to stop them."</p>
			<p>"How?" Pohatu wondered. "We still don't have our powers. It sounds like we don't even have the Exo-Toa option anymore. All we have is a few paltry mask powers."</p>
			<p>"Yes, a few mask powers," Gali said. "And our wits. And our duty."</p>
			<p>Tahu strode toward the hole. "And that will have to be enough."</p>
			<p><i>A few paltry mask powers,</i> Tahu thought as he levitated down the long, dark tunnel. <i>If the others only knew about the not-so-paltry mask power I hold-but is now finally the time to reveal it?</i></p>
			<p>He thought back to that moment in the suva in Ta-Koro. He could almost hear Vakama's solemn words echoing in his head. <i>He who controls time controls reality-controls everything.</i></p>
			<p>Tahu grimaced. Was he ready to control everything? Could anyone ever be truly ready for that-even a powerful Toa Nuva?</p>
			<p>Tahu slowed his descent as the lower cavern came into view. All six of the Bohrok-Kal were there, gathered around the floating cube. What was left of the Exo-Toa lay scattered on the stone floor nearby-most of the suits had been pulled to pieces.</p>
			<p>"There must be something we can do," Gali said.</p>
			<p>Tahu took a deep breath, suddenly feeling in his heart that the decision was already made. It had been destined-all he had to do was accept it.</p>
			<p>"There is," he said.</p>
			<h2>12. The Great Mask of Time</h2>
			<p>Gali glanced at Tahu, wondering what the Fire Toa had in mind. She gasped as she saw his mask begin to glow a fiery orange and morph into an odd, primitive shape.</p>
			<p>"Tahu!" she exclaimed. "What are you doing?"</p>
			<p>"Something I hoped I would never have to do," Tahu replied hollowly. "Something that could mean the end of everything. I call upon-the Great Mask of Time!"</p>
			<p>Gali felt her heart constrict with terror. "Then you may have doomed us all," she whispered bleakly.</p>
			<p>She was distracted by an echoing voice drifting up from the cavern below. "Free us, my children!" it wailed joyfully.</p>
			<p>"Yes!" a second voice joined the first. "Unlock this prison, my children, and set us free!"</p>
			<p>"The Bohrok queens," Tahu said. "I'm going in."</p>
			<p>Without waiting for agreement, he levitated downward. Gali followed along with the other Toa. Soon she was low enough to see into the cavern beyond the cube, where the enormous, monstrous forms of Cahdok and Gahdok were barely visible beyond a hazy wall.</p>
			<p>The Bahrag soon spotted the Toa Nuva as well. "You are too late!" Cahdok howled, her words slightly garbled by the mass of protodermis that was holding her hostage.</p>
			<p>As her feet touched the stone floor, Gali glanced worriedly at Tahu. He was standing beside her, his head bowed in concentration.</p>
			<p>"Gali, I must use this power," he said. "I must master it-or all is lost."</p>
			<p>"But if you fail," she said urgently, "Mata Nui will fall. All of reality may be undone!"</p>
			<p>The Vahi glowed brightly. "Then I will not fail," Tahu said grimly.</p>
			<p>Gali held her breath as a ripple of energy radiated out from Tahu's mask. The air seemed to quiver as the time energy moved through it.</p>
			<p>The Vahi's energy struck the Bohrok-Kal just as they raised their clawed arms to move the icons into place. Their movements slowed more and more, until the motion was barely perceptible.</p>
			<p>"It's working!" Onua cried in relief.</p>
			<p>For a moment, Gali shared his joy. Then she glanced at Tahu. His hands were clenched into fists, and every muscle of his body quivered uncontrollably.</p>
			<p>"I can't...hold back time...much longer!" Tahu gasped, his voice twisted with exertion. "Go! Get our symbols back!"</p>
			<p>The other five Toa Nuva leaped forward as one. As Gali headed toward the Nuhvok-Kal, she could see its krana-kal. Despite the time slowdown, it still appeared to be pulsing evenly.</p>
			<p>Gali paused, staring at it as it shimmered and glowed. Was the time mutation playing tricks with her eyes, or was it-changing?</p>
			<p>"Hold on," she said to the others. "Something's happening. Their krana-kal are changing-turning silver."</p>
			<p>Kopaka moved forward for a better look. He was stopped a short distance away, as if he'd just run into a wall. "A field of energy surrounds them," he said grimly. "In the final moments before they complete their task, they must be protected from all harm. Even the slowing of time could not stop it."</p>
			<p>"Forgive me if I test your theory," Onua said, hurling the chunk of stone at the Bohrok-Kal with all his might.</p>
			<p><i>ZZZZZZZZZK!</i></p>
			<p>The stone struck the force field and disintegrated. Gali shook her head worriedly as she glanced at Tahu, who was still shaking with the effort to control the Great Mask of Time.</p>
			<p>Lewa shuddered. "It's over," he said. "Even when we still had our powers, we were barely able to fightsnare the Bahrag at their ordinary strength. We've failed. Failed our villages, our people..."</p>
			<p>For once, words seemed to desert the Air Toa, and he merely shook his head to complete his point. Gali glanced around the group. The other Toa Nuva looked just as dejected as Lewa. Onua was staring in disbelief at the spot where the stone had disintegrated. Nearby, Pohatu was shifting his weight nervously from one foot to the other. Kopaka said nothing as usual, staring fixedly at the Bahrag in their glutinous cage. And for the first time since she'd known him, Gali saw defeat lurking in Tahu's eyes.</p>
			<p>But Gali herself was not yet ready to give up. Unity-duty-destiny-so far, the Matoran creed had never failed them.</p>
			<p>"Remember," she said thoughtfully, "we have always had the most success when we have been willing to dig deep inside our hearts and risk <i>everything</i>-even our very selves..."</p>
			<h2>13. The Power Within</h2>
			<p>The other Toa stared at Gali, confused. "What do you mean?" Pohatu asked her.</p>
			<p>"Our powers!" Gali explained, her eyes lighting with hope. "If the essence of our powers is housed in those symbols, maybe we can use that against the Bohrok-Kal!"</p>
			<p>Tahu stared at her as the power of the Vahi began to waver and weaken. Tahu himself was weakening, also. "How?" he asked, pushing out the single word with effort.</p>
			<p>"We need to pool our willpower," Gali said. "Reach out to our symbols. Even if it means freeing the Bohrok-Kal from the Vahi."</p>
			<p>Tahu shook his head, not understanding. He was tired-so tired. Perhaps it was time to give up, to allow the Vahi to overwhelm him...</p>
			<p>"Tahu!" Kopaka said sharply. "The mask. You have to send it away-now."</p>
			<p>The Ice Toa's voice was always enough to set Tahu on edge. Now it broke through the haze in his mind. <i>Who is he to tell me what to do?</i></p>
			<p>But Kopaka was right. The Vahi had served its purpose.</p>
			<p>"Vahi," he croaked. "Be gone!"</p>
			<p>He nearly collapsed as the intense time power released him and the Vahi faded. Pohatu reached forward to catch him. "Easy, brother," the Stone Toa said. "There you go. Now come on, pull yourself together-we have work to do."</p>
			<p>Tahu nodded, pulling in a deep breath. "I am ready," he said.</p>
			<p>The Bohrok-Kal, released from the power of the Vahi, were beginning to stir. "Hurry," Onua said urgently. "We don't have much time."</p>
			<p>The Toa Nuva turned to face the cube. Tahu could already feel his strength flowing back into him. He gathered that energy, pushing it outward toward the the power symbols. Around him, he could feel the other Toa Nuva doing the same.</p>
			<p>Tahu had never felt such an intense wave of energy. But would it work? Would their combined power stop the Bohrok-Kal? A glow surrounded the Toa, growing brighter with every passing second. Slowly, the glow took separate form, moving forward toward the Bohrok-Kal.</p>
			<p>It neared the force field surrounding the Bohrok-Kal, which their krana-kal were still holding steady. "Concentrate!" Tahu urged the others. "We must break through!"</p>
			<p>He could see that the power symbols were beginning to glow in response to the Toa Nuva's energy. The glow pulsed outward, surrounding the Bohrok-Kal.</p>
			<p>"What is happening?" the Nuhvok-Kal said in its metallic voice. "I feel stronger! The Toa Nuva symbols are feeding us energy!"</p>
			<p><i>I hope this works,</i> Tahu thought, as the Bohrok-Kal all pulled the icons back from the cube, gazing at them in wonder. <i>If not, we might have given the enemy even more power than it already had...</i></p>
			<p>The Lehvak-Kal held up its icon. "Yes!" it said. "Cahdok and Gahdok do not need the swarms-with this power, we can return Mata Nui to the Before-Time."</p>
			<p>"No!" Gahdok howled. "My children, do not be distracted from your task!"</p>
			<p>But the Bohrok-Kal seemed not to hear her. "We will rule beside the Bahrag!" the Gahlok-Kal cried, its body pulsing. "We will-" It shuddered, the energy turning darker.</p>
			<p>"What is happening?" the Tahnok-Kal wailed as its body quivered uncontrollably, waves of energy rippling and sparking over it.</p>
			<p>"Good question," Pohatu whispered.</p>
			<p>The Bohrok-Kal were all convulsing by now. "No!" the Gahlok-Kal shrieked as its body lurched. "Too much power-can't control!"</p>
			<p>"You fools!" Cahdok roared from within her prison. "You have been tricked!"</p>
			<p>"Yes," Gali said calmly from the head of the group. "You wanted our power, monsters. Now let us see if you can handle it!"</p>
			<p>The Nuhvok-Kal dropped the symbol it was holding.</p>
			<p>"So much power," the Nuhvok-Kal moaned. "Can't control my energies...Gravity crushing me..."</p>
			<p>Tahu gasped as the Nuhvok-Kal's powerful body began to crumple and fold in upon itself. "He's throwing out an uncontrolled gravity field-it's going to crush him!"</p>
			<p>"Bahrag, aid us!" the Nuhvok-Kal pleaded, its voice distorted by the weight crushing down on it. "Before it is too laaaaaaaate..."</p>
			<p>The last word trailed off into nothingness. The gravitational force had finally overwhelmed it, compressing the creature into a miniature black hole in the middle of the chamber.</p>
			<p>Lewa gasped. "It's awaygone!" he murmured in amazement.</p>
			<p>Tahu didn't respond. He was watching the Pahrak-Kal, which was struggling against its own power overload. It had hurled its Toa Nuva icon away, but it was too late. The Pahrak-Kal's armored body was glowing with a plasma-fueled heat so intense that the stone floor started to melt beneath its feet.</p>
			<p>"I will contain this power!" The Pahrak-Kal sounded drippy and slow, as if it, too, were melting. "I am Pahrak-Kal!" I cannot be defeated!"</p>
			<p>But a moment later, the floor beneath the Pahrak-Kal gave way entirely, and the creature dropped away through it out of sight.</p>
			<p>Tahu glanced toward the cube just in time to see the Gahlok-Kal stepping toward it, one of the power icons still clutched in its hand. "Uh-oh," Tahu said, pointing.</p>
			<p>"The Bahrag will be free!" the Gahlok-Kal cried. "You cannot defeat me with my own power!"</p>
			<p>"Should we do something?" Lewa wondered aloud.</p>
			<p>Tahu shook his head. "One symbol will not free the Bahrag," he said. "It would need to collect all six of them. And I suspect that's going to be harder than it realizes..."</p>
			<p>At that moment they all became aware that the pieces of shattered Exo-Toa armor were moving. "Look!" Gali said. "It's the Gahlok-Kal's magnetic energy. It's going to-"</p>
			<p>Before she could finish her sentence, the Exo-Toa pieces suddenly shot toward the Gahlok-Kal, pulled there by the creature's pulsing magnetic force.</p>
			<p>"Oh, no!" the Gahlok-Kal cried, a split second before the pieces struck.</p>
			<p>Tahu had turned to watch the Lehvak-Kal. The incredible vacuum forces it was emitting finally overwhelmed it, sending it shooting upward like a rocket. It smashed through the cavern ceiling and disappeared.</p>
			<p>The Tahnok-Kal had teetered over to a corner of the cave. There, it stood locked into place, a prisoner of its own electrical forces, which swirled in the air around it and formed a constant shimmer of concentrated lightning.</p>
			<p>Onua nodded toward the helpless creature. "I expect that one will stay there until it finally runs out of energy entirely."</p>
			<p>That meant the only Bohrok-Kal left was the Kohrak-Kal. It was standing near the cube, buffeted by waves of undiluted sound. The sonic forces were so focused around their core that Tahu could hear nothing but faint <i>zips</i> and <i>kreeees.</i> But he shuddered to imagine what it must sound like to the creature trapped within its own sonic vortex.</p>
			<p>As he watched, the Kohrak-Kal's body shuddered and gave way to the pressure, crumbling into dust before the pummeling sound waves. Only its silvery krana-kal escaped, scuttling away into the shadows.</p>
			<p>The six power symbols lay on the floor. Slowly, the glow that had surrounded them faded away, and the cavern was still.</p>
			<p>Lewa let out a long breath. "The Bohrok-Kal," he said. "Are they...?"</p>
			<p>"They did not live as we understand life, so they cannot die," Kopaka answered. "But they have been defeated."</p>
			<p>Tahu nodded. "Did you see that krana-kal escaping?" he asked.</p>
			<p>"I did," Gali said. "I expect the others managed to get away, too. But I don't think we need to worry. Without the Bohrok-Kal to house them, the krana-kal will remain powerless."</p>
			<p>"Then we have won!" Tahu said, hardly daring to believe it.</p>
			<p>Kopaka nodded. "It seems so," he said, his cool voice tinged with admiration. "Thanks to our wise sister. How did you know, Gali?"</p>
			<p>Gali shrugged. "I didn't," she admitted. "I gambled that tapping the power of the symbols would feed the Bohrok-Kal more energy than they could control. In the end, the only power that could defeat them was their own." She turned toward Tahu. "There's one thing I don't understand," she said. "The Vahi-where did you get it?"</p>
			<p>"Vakama gave it to me," Tahu said. "Along with a warning-that its power might be too great for even a Toa to wield. He was nearly right."</p>
			<p>As he remembered the surge of power that the Vahi had sent through him, a surge of energy welled up. He held up his sword, seeing flames dancing along its length. Hardly daring to believe what he saw, he pointed the sword at a nearby rock, blasting it with searing flames.</p>
			<p>Kopaka was watching him. "So our powers have returned," he said. Glancing toward the cavern ceiling, he pointed his own ice blade. A moment later an icy staircase had been formed.</p>
			<p>Tahu led the other Toa Nuva toward the icy staircase. The Bahrag were once again safely contained in their underground prison. It was time for the Toa Nuva to return to the surface.</p>
			<p>None of the Toa Nuva could relax before the first rays of sun penetrated the dark tunnel-a sign that they were at last reaching the surface.</p>
			<p>Once safely above, the six Toa sank to the ground in relief. Gali glanced over at Tahu with unease, still trying to process what he had just revealed-still trying to understand how he had kept the Great Mask of Time a secret for so long. What other secrets might he be hiding?</p>
			<p>But she suppressed her unease-now was not the time. Instead, forcing a smile, she turned to her fellow Toa Nuva and said, "Well, brothers, what do you think? Will we be able to put Mata Nui right again?"</p>
			<p>"Of course," Tahu said. "I think we've finally learned our lesson."</p>
			<p>"What lesson?" Lewa said. "You mean the lesson that a Toa's work is never done?"</p>
			<p>Pohatu chuckled. "No, he's probably talking about the lesson that we should always pay attention to Gali's hunches."</p>
			<p>"Or that only bad-yuck things happen underground," Lewa added, grinning.</p>
			<p>"Yes, all of those lessons, brothers," Tahu said with a smile. "But also the most important one of all. Don't you get it?"</p>
			<p>"I know what you're thinking, brother," Gali said, hoping she was right. "Three little words, right?"</p>
			<p>Kopaka nodded, speaking up for the first time since Tahu's speech had ended. "Unity, duty, destiny," he said.</p>
			<p>"Right," Tahu said. "When we keep those three words in mind, the Toa Nuva can do <i>anything</i>!"</p>

			<h1>BIONICLE Chronicles #4: Tales of the Masks</h1>
			<h3>Greg Farshtey</h3>
			<h2>Introduction</h2>
			<p>Turaga Vakama, elder of the village of Ta-Koro, sat in silence. The council fire had burned down to ashes. The Matoran, tired from their labors, had gone to sleep and the island of Mata Nui was quiet.</p>
			<p>It should have been a time of celebration for the Turaga. The shadow of the insectlike Bohrok swarms and Bohrok-Kal had finally been lifted from the land. The Toa had returned from their struggle and joined with the Matoran to repair damage done to the villages. All were enjoying a rare feeling on Mata Nui: peace.</p>
			<p>Only the Turaga stood apart from the joyous work. They knew many secrets about the past and the possible future. The time had come to decide if those secrets should be shared.</p>
			<p>"We have to tell the Toa the truth," Turaga Nokama of Ga-Koro insisted. "They have earned this through their great deeds. How many times have they saved us all from Makuta's power?"</p>
			<p>Onewa, Turaga of Po-Koro, shook his head. "That is true, sister. But they have done so without knowing any more than was necessary about the past. I prefer it stay that way."</p>
			<p>Nokama began to reply but was cut off by an angry string of clicks and whistles coming from Turaga Nuju of Ko-Koro. Matoro, Nuju's interpreter, struggled to keep up with the rapid speech. "Um, Turaga Nuju says..." Matoro began. "Oh, no, I can't say that about Turaga Onewa!"</p>
			<p>Nokama tried not to smile but failed. Even Vakama chuckled, saying, "Our friends from Ko-Koro always go right to the heart of the matter. Still, Onewa has a point. We all know too well what can happen when knowledge is in the wrong hands."</p>
			<p>"We also know, brother, the heartpain of not being trusted ourselves," Turaga Matau from Le-Koro said. "I say the Toa are wise enough and strong enough to know all. They must know all if they are to fulfill their destiny!"</p>
			<p>Onewa slammed his stone hammer on the ground. "Destiny? Let them show unity first! Since they became Toa Nuva, they have done nothing but argue with one another. Kopaka squabbles with Tahu, Gali avoids speaking with either of them...are these the acts of worthy Toa?"</p>
			<p>"There was a time, hammerer, when Toa argued quite often," said Nokama. "I am quite sure you remember. Yet somehow they found the will to do what had to be done."</p>
			<p>"That was...different," Onewa replied with a shrug. "Perhaps these Toa do not have the same wisdom."</p>
			<p>"Wiselearning is hard to come by, if no one will teach," said Matau.</p>
			<p>Whenua, ruler of the underground village of Onu-Koro, had said nothing throughout the debate. He had merely sat and listened to the worry and the anger, the hope and the fear. It was not so different from listening to the sounds of the earth, hearing the approach of a quake or the roar of a subterranean river.</p>
			<p>Finally, the wise Turaga rose from his seat and looked around at his old friends. "Brothers...and sister... the Onu-Matoran live in darkness. It is our way. We thrive where the light does not reach, and when we walk on the surface, we must shield our eyes from the sun's glow."</p>
			<p>Nuju clicked something in response. Matoro opened his mouth to translate, but Vakama held up a hand. "Be at ease. I believe we can all guess what he is saying...and the answer is Whenua will make his point in his own time, as he has always done."</p>
			<p>"When I was younger, I believed all answers could be found in the past," continued Whenua. "I still believe the past should be our teacher. Not so very long ago, the Toa came to our shores and brought hope. They defeated every danger that threatened Mata Nui...and as Onewa says, they did it all in darkness. But what more could they have accomplished with the light of truth?"</p>
			<p>"I must agree," Nokama said quietly.</p>
			<p>"Knowledge, my friends...knowledge is the key," Whenua said. "Without it, for all their power, the Toa will not see. We must share our secrets."</p>
			<p>Now Vakama rose, firestaff in hand, and lifted his head to look at the six stars in the heavens above. "If they knew...If they knew what really happened in Metru Nui, how would they feel? Would they welcome knowing they are not truly alone, or be angry at our deception? How are we to know the right thing to do?"</p>
			<p>"The same way we always know," said Nokama. "We turn to the legends. The Toa learned much in their quest for the Kanohi Nuva masks. Stripped of their powers, they still found a way to succeed. Perhaps in the tales of their adventures, we will find the answers we seek."</p>
			<p>"I have heard the tales," answered Vakama.</p>
			<p>"Heard, yes...but have you listened?" said Nokama.</p>
			<p>Vakama thought about her words for a very long time. Perhaps Nokama was right. There might have been something in the Toa's most recent deeds that he had missed.</p>
			<p>He returned to his place in the circle. "Once again, the Turaga of water proves to be the wisest of us all. Very well, then. Each of us will tell a tale of the Toa's search for the Kanohi Nuva. At the end of our storytelling, we will make our decision. Now, who shall begin?"</p>
			<p>Vakama's answer was a burst of clicks and whistles from Nuju. Matoro nodded and reported, "The Turaga says...he says you have all created enough hot air to melt the glaciers of Ko-Wahi. He will tell his tale first, and no more will be needed after that."</p>
			<p>"Ha! I sometimes think, brother, that too much time in the ice and snow has caused your brain to freeze," Onewa said. "Allow a true storyteller to share a tale!"</p>
			<p>Nokama laid a gentle hand on Nuju's arm. "My friend, I have no doubt your story will be the greatest of all and make ours look poor by comparison. So why not save it until later in the evening, when it will be most appreciated?"</p>
			<p>In all the time he had known her, Nuju had never been able to say no to Nokama...not for long, anyway. He looked at Vakama and gave a nod.</p>
			<p>"Then it is settled," Vakama announced. "Begin your tale, Onewa, for we are turned to hear."</p>
			<p>Onewa smiled. "And well you should be. My story begins in the vast, frozen region of Ko-Wahi, on a very different night from this. A night when it seemed that all was lost for the Toa and Mata Nui itself..."</p>
			<h2>1. Onewa's Tale: The Mountain</h2>
			<p>When Kopaka Nuva, the Toa of Ice and protector of the Village of Ko-Koro, is troubled, he travels to a remote spot on the slopes of Mount Ihu to think. The only sound is the wind rushing through the mountain passes and the crunch of ice beneath his feet. Even other Ko-Matoran rarely go there, so no other living being interrupts his time alone.</p>
			<p>Most of the time.</p>
			<p>"Brother!" Pohatu's voice boomed across the snowfield. Somewhere in the distance, an avalanche started by his shout roared down the mountainside.</p>
			<p>Kopaka turned and saw the powerful form of the Toa of Stone struggling to walk through the hip-deep snowdrifts. It was tough going for one as heavy as Pohatu. He no doubt needed help making it through.</p>
			<p>Without a word, Kopaka resumed walking up the icy pathway.</p>
			<p>"I know you can hear me!" Pohatu shouted. Kopaka narrowly dodged the rain of icicles shattered by that sound.</p>
			<p>"Mata Nui can hear you, and he is sleeping," Kopaka muttered.</p>
			<p>Down below, Pohatu watched as his brother Toa continued slowly and steadily up the mountain. Walking through snow was almost as bad as being underwater. Then again, Pohatu supposed snow did combine the worst parts of Gali's realm with those of Kopaka's. Still, he was determined to reach his destination, with or without the help of the Toa of Ice, and although he wore the Great Mask of Speed, Pohatu hesitated to use it. On this slippery surface, running would not get him there any faster.</p>
			<p>Pohatu continued to follow Kopaka through the darkness, doing his best to ignore the cold. In turn, Kopaka ignored <i>him,</i> hoping he would turn back. Sometimes that worked with Pohatu, but not often.</p>
			<p>"Help! Brother, help me!"</p>
			<p>Kopaka whirled and saw Pohatu floundering in a drift. The Toa of Po-Koro had lost his footing and gone down. Without something solid to hold on to, Pohatu was finding it impossible to rise.</p>
			<p>Frowning, Kopaka split his ice blade in two and attached the ends to his feet. In an instant, he was flying down the mountain on his power ice-skates, sparks flying as the protodermis blades sliced through the ice. He was aiming for the curved lip of a ridge, and as always, his aim was true. His momentum sent him soaring through the chill air toward Pohatu.</p>
			<p>Kopaka waited until he was at the height of his arc, then curled up and did a series of midair flips. He hit the slope at just the right angle and slid to a stop beside the fallen Toa.</p>
			<p>"I will help you up," Kopaka said, as quietly as a snowfall. "Then you will leave my land."</p>
			<p>"I have a better idea," replied Pohatu, springing to his feet. "I'll get up on my own, thanks, and then we'll travel together."</p>
			<p>"You faked your fall."</p>
			<p>"Oh, no, brother, the fall was real...tricky things, these snowfields," said Pohatu. "I welcomed the rest. And while I was lying there, I thought, <i>Trying to get to Kopaka is really quite tiring. If I stay here, perhaps he will come to me.</i>"</p>
			<p>"There is a blizzard coming. With my ice powers stolen by the Bohrok-Kal, I will not be able to stop it," said Kopaka grimly. "Turn back."</p>
			<p>Pohatu folded his mighty arms across his chest. "Here I am, and here I'll stay."</p>
			<p>Kopaka shrugged. "Very well. When I reach Ko-Koro, I will tell Turaga Nuju to have you dug out when the thaw arrives...if it ever does." With that, he turned and walked away.</p>
			<p>Pohatu frowned and hurried after him. "I thought we could help each other. There are many masks to find. Don't you remember how well we worked as a team when we first arrived on Mata Nui?"</p>
			<p>"You buried me in a landslide, as I recall," said Kopaka.</p>
			<p>"Oh. Well, I didn't do it on purpose. Besides, that can't happen now. I've lost my powers, just like you have."</p>
			<p>Kopaka stopped dead and looked over his shoulder. "Pohatu, I do not want your help. I do not need your help. I will find the Kanohi Nuva on my own."</p>
			<p>Before Pohatu could answer, Kopaka had vanished into the darkness. The Toa of Stone stared after him for some time. Then he started to follow again, careful to stay in Kopaka's footsteps.</p>
			<p>The blizzard that struck was one of the fiercest ever known in Ko-Wahi. The winds roared down from the summit of Mount Ihu, carrying blinding snow and stinging pellets of ice. In moments, every trace of Kopaka's passage had vanished beneath the drifts.</p>
			<p>Pohatu stopped to think. He knew his brother Toa was following an ice path, but where was it? If he began digging through the snow to search, he would freeze long before it could be found. Unless...unless he could find a new use for the Mask of Speed.</p>
			<p>Doing his best to ignore the subzero temperatures and the blowing snow, Pohatu planted his feet on the ground. Then he held his arms out in front of him and began to rotate them, faster and faster, letting the power of the Mask of Speed, Kanohi Kakama Nuva, flow through him. In seconds, his arms became a blur as they sent twin blasts of air before him, which blew the snow aside to reveal the hidden path.</p>
			<p>"Let's see Kopaka do that," Pohatu said to himself as he resumed his journey.</p>
			<p>Kopaka had more to worry about than the snowstorm. When his elemental powers were stolen, his resistance to extreme cold disappeared as well. For the first time, he could feel the numbing temperatures of the Ko-Wahi region slowing him down. All he wanted to do was rest, preferably someplace warm. He would lie down and sleep, only for a few moments, in the shelter of a rock outcropping. Then he would be ready to resume his search for the masks.</p>
			<p>The cold and the darkness were closing in on him. In icy dreams, he saw two of the insectlike Bohrok-Kal, Kohrak-Kal and Nuhvok-Kal, stealing the symbol of his Toa power from his village. His energy was gone. He could hear them shouting his name, over and over, and something else...a terribly familiar growl.</p>
			<p>Kopaka awoke with a start. Standing over him, saliva dripping from its jaws, was a Muaka. The largest and fiercest predator in Ko-Wahi, the great cat saw anything that moved as prey. Its claws dug into the icy floor as it sniffed Kopaka, trying to determine if the Toa was still alive and might be a threat.</p>
			<p><i>Once I would have been far more than a threat, Rahi,</i> Kopaka thought, using the Matoran name for a wild animal. <i>Two days ago, a single ice blast from my blade would have left you frozen solid. But today it is just a powerless tool and little defense against a beast of such power. The Bohrok-Kal have stolen all my Toa energies.</i></p>
			<p>It was then that Kopaka heard his name shouted again. That was no dream. It was Pohatu, still searching through the snow for his brother Toa. Better still, it was enough to distract the Muaka just long enough for Kopaka to roll away, grab his blade, and sprint toward the mountainside.</p>
			<p>The Muaka bellowed and pursued, its long legs easily making up the ground between them. Kopaka could just see a narrow ledge high on the rock face. If he could reach it, he would be safe, since it was too high for the Muaka to reach. But somehow he doubted the Rahi would give him a chance to climb.</p>
			<p>There was no time to plan. Kopaka broke into a dead run, holding his ice blade in both hands. He could feel the Muaka's breath on his back. His feet were slipping underneath him, and he knew any fall would be his last.</p>
			<p>Eyes locked on the mountain, Kopaka counted down the seconds. He would get one chance to make this work. If he failed, Ko-Koro would need another protector. <i>So I will not fail,</i> he said to himself.</p>
			<p>Before the Muaka could react, Kopaka planted one end of his ic blade into the ground and vaulted high into the air. He struck the mountain hard and began to slide down the ice-covered rock. He was slipping off the ledge, with the Muaka waiting below, jaws open wide.</p>
			<p>Something whizzed past him, burying itself in the rock with a loud metallic sound. Kopaka reached out and grabbed it. It was one of Pohatu's climbing claws! Down below, the Muaka snapped at the Toa's heels. With his last bit of strength, Kopaka hauled himself onto the ledge.</p>
			<P>The Muaka snarled and leaped, scrambling in vain to hold on and then sliding back down to the snow. It was preparing for another try when the sharp crack of rock striking rock caught its attention. The sound repeated three times before the Muaka decided it might mean easier prey and loped off to investigate.</p>
			<p>As soon as it was gone, Pohatu appeared. "I might not still command the rock," he said, "but at least I can still toss one."</p>
			<p>Kopaka yanked the climbing claw free and tossed it to the Toa of Stone. "I thought you had turned back, Pohatu."</p>
			<p>"I was going to," the Toa said, shrugging, "but mask hunting alone is like playing the sport of kolhii alone-good practice, but not much fun."</p>
			<p>Kopaka slid down into a snowbank and approached. When he spoke, his voice had a bit less ice in it than usual. "You should go home, Pohatu. This is no place for you...perhaps not even for me, anymore."</p>
			<p>"Turaga Onewa said something to me before I left Po-Koro," replied Pohatu. "He said it's easy to be a hero when you have plenty of power and your only worry is whatever enemy is foo enough to challenge you. It's not so easy when all you have is your wits and your biggest enemy is yourself."</p>
			<p>The eyepiece of Kopaka's mask extended and whirred as he scanned the mountainside. "That sounds like Onewa. You two are much like the stone you represent. Solid. Practical. Down-to-earth."</p>
			<p>"Well, thanks, I-"</p>
			<p>"Dense. Hardheaded," Kopaka continued. "And stubborn."</p>
			<p>"You're welcome, Kopaka," Pohatu snapped. "Oh, no, rescuing you was my pleasure."</p>
			<p>Kopaka glared at his brother Toa. "If your trick had failed, the Muaka might have had us both. The strength of the Toa would have been reduced by one-third and our villages would be in peril. Foolish risks are a luxury we cannot afford."</p>
			<p>Pohatu pointed up the mountain. "Then maybe we should get out of the way of the avalanche!"</p>
			<p>It was too late to react. A wall of white slammed into the two Toa, knocking them both off their feet and carrying them along in its wake. Helpless, they tumbled end over end down Mount Ihu, bashing into rocks and almost losing their Kanohi. Kopaka made a desperate effort to will the avalanche away, but not even the slightest trace of his powers remained.</p>
			<p>Toa of Ice and Stone wound up sprawled in a heap at the base of the mountain, half buried in snow. Long minutes passed before they staggered to their feet, exhausted and aching. "I hate winter," Pohatu growled.</p>
			<p>"The Mask of Shielding would have protected us from that," Kopaka said. "We need to find the Kanohi Nuva now. As long as you are here, Pohatu...you might as well travel with me."</p>
			<p>"It's certainly been fun so far," the Toa of Stone replied, brushing snow from his arms and legs. "Onewa mentioned a Mask of Shielding in an ice cave near here. Any idea where that might be?"</p>
			<p>Kopaka did not answer. He stepped away from Pohatu and activated the power of his mask, enabling him to peer through tons of stone into the network of caves within Mount Ihu. It was the work of moments to find a cavern in which there was a lone Kanohi Hau Nuva, the Mask of Shielding.</p>
			<p>"It is nearby," he reported. "Perhaps half a kio up the mountain. But the entrance is-"</p>
			<p>Before Kopaka's eyes, Pohatu vanished, only to reappear a split second later. "Blocked by boulders. I know. I saw," the Toa of Stone said. "Mask of Speed, remember?"</p>
			<p>Kopaka's eyes narrowed and his voice was like sleet striking a suva shrine. "Don't do that again."</p>
			<p>Pohatu was tempted to argue, but the storm was growing worse. Neither Toa could see more than a short distance ahead. They walked together in an uncomfortable silence, fighting the wind and the snow as they made their way back up the mountain.</p>
			<p>Finally, though, it was too much for the Toa of Stone. "What's the matter with you, brother? I rescue you, you aren't pleased; I scout ahead to save time, you aren't pleased. Is there no pleasing you, Toa of Ice?"</p>
			<p>Kopaka stopped and said, "I am not here to be pleased. I am here to find Kanohi Nuva so I can regain my stolen powers and truly be the Toa of Ice again. If you wish to help me, fine. If you wish to talk...seek out Toa Lewa."</p>
			<p>Not another word was spoken by either.</p>
			<p>	*	*	*</p>
			<p>The cave mouth was not a pleasant sight. The entrance was blocked by massive boulders that had fallen sometime during the night. Even Onua Nuva, Toa of Earth, helped by his Mask of Strength, would have had a difficult time clearing them all away.</p>
			<p>Kopaka set to work trying to pry the stones free with his ice blade. But the tool was not designed for that type of work and he soon gave up in frustration. Pohatu, meanwhile, had done little but stand to one side, observing.</p>
			<p>"Difficult," Kopaka said.</p>
			<p>"No, no," answered Pohatu. "Simple. Watch me."</p>
			<p>Pohatu approached the pile of stone and gently laid his hands upon it, first on one spot, then another. He almost seemed to be listening to the rock, though how he could hear anything above the howl of the winds, Kopaka had no idea.</p>
			<p>"It's a puzzle, brother," said Pohatu. "Each stone supports another. Alone, they are powerful. Together, even a Toa cannot budge them. But the key to the puzzle is there, if you know how to look."</p>
			<p>"Where did you learn this?" asked Kopaka.</p>
			<p>Seeing that his brother Toa was genuinely interested, Pohatu smiled. "Onewa taught me. He said that his knowledge of rock is older than the rocks themselves. Not quite sure what he meant by that, but it certainly sounds impressive. Ah! Here we are."</p>
			<p>Pohatu drew back his leg and slammed a center stone with a mighty kick. The rock splintered and flew apart. Robbed of their support, the other stones collapsed, revealing the cavern entrance.</p>
			<p>"See? When they can't work together and share the burden, they can't perform their task."</p>
			<p>For just the briefest instant, Kopaka almost smiled. "Yes, brother. Perhaps I do see."</p>
			<p>Kopaka led the way into the ice cavern with Pohatu close behind. The Toa of Ice carried a lightstone, its glow reflecting off of the polished surfaces of the cave. The only sounds were their breathing and their heavy footsteps on the ice.</p>
			<p>Pohatu lost track of how far they walked. He was beginning to wonder if they would be able to find their way out again, then reminded himself that Kopaka's Mask of X-Ray Vision would show the way. He felt uncomfortable here, with so much ice cutting him off from the feel of stone.</p>
			<p>Their progress was halted by a great crevasse that yawned in the cavern floor. Pohatu crouched and peered into the gap. "It's blacker than Makuta's spirit down there, brother. No telling how far it goes."</p>
			<p>"We will find out," said Kopaka. "The Kanohi Hau is at the bottom."</p>
			<p>Pohatu sighed. "Someday I am going to have a long talk with whoever hid these Kanohi," he said, checking to make sure his climbing claws were well fitted.</p>
			<p>Kopaka split his ice blade in two, taking half in each hand. They would not be as efficient as Pohatu's claws, but they were strong enough and sharp enough to serve as climbing spikes. He scanned the crevasse again, satisfied that there was nothing down there but the mask, and nodded to Pohatu. "We begin."</p>
			<p>Pohatu rammed a claw into the ice wall and swung his legs over the edge of the gap. "I hope Mata Nui appreciates all this, if he ever wakes up."</p>
			<p>The climb down was slow and treacherous. Once one of Pohatu's claws slipped, and only fast action by Kopaka kept the Toa of Stone from plummeting to the floor far below. By the time they reached the bottom, both Toa were exhausted.</p>
			<p>The gray Mask of Shielding, the Kanohi Hau Nuva, was wedged in a far corneer, perhaps a hundred kio away. Its power would protect a Toa from any physical attack provided it was not unexpected. Of all the Great Masks, it was perhaps the most valuable to possess right now, when the Toa were without their elemental energies.</p>
			<p>Kopaka took a step toward the mask, but Pohatu grabbed his arm. "Hold it, brother! Do you feel that?"</p>
			<p>"What?"</p>
			<p>"I am not one with the earth like Onua, but something is wrong...very wrong."</p>
			<p>Suddenly a violent earth tremor struck the mountain, shaking it like it was a toy in the hands of a Matoran. Pohatu looked up in time to see the roof of the cavern far above collapsing, sending tons of rock and ice plunging toward them.</p>
			<p>Pohatu didn't hesitate. He rammed Kopaka hard with his shoulder, sending the Toa of Ice flying across the icy floor toward the Kanohi. Kopaka slid to a stop against the wall, an arm's length from the mask. Stunned, he looked up to see half the mountain about to crush Pohatu.</p>
			<p>Kopaka scrambled and grabbed the mask, slamming it onto his face. The Hau Nuva mask had the power to protect those near the wearer as well. If he was in time, the shield might extend to Pohatu. If not...</p>
			<p>The shield flared to life around Kopaka. Stone rained down upon it and shattered to harmless fragments, while the ancient energies of the Kanohi kept the Toa of Ice safe. But there was no sign of Pohatu.</p>
			<p>It felt like an eternity before the quake ceased. Kopaka scrambled over the rubble toward where Pohatu had last been standing and began to dig with his hands. "Pohatu! Pohatu!" he shouted, but the only answer was the echo in the cave.</p>
			<p>In the end, he was forced to give up. Nothing stirred beneath the rock.</p>
			<p>"Good-bye, my brother," Kopaka said. "Perhaps we were too different to truly be friends. But a noble heart beat within that body of stone."</p>
			<p>Grimly, he turned from Pohatu's final resting place and began the long journey back to the surface.</p>
			<p>A full day passed before Kopaka reached the village of Po-Koro. Matoran lined its newly constructed walls, on the alert for any appearance of the Bohrok-Kal. The approach of the Toa of Ice sent a stir through the guards, for all knew he rarely ventured out of Ko-Wahi these days.</p>
			<p>Turaga Onewa met him at the gate. "You journey alone, Kopaka, in this dangerous land?"</p>
			<p>"No," replied Kopaka. "I journey with the memory of a fallen brother." He handed Onewa the Kanohi Hau Nuva. "This belongs here. Without Pohatu, it would never have been found...nor would I be alive to carry it. He died as he lived, a true hero."</p>
			<p>"I thank you for that, brother!" The booming voice came from behind Kopaka. All who saw him that day would later say that the Toa of Ice was not so cold as some believed. For he turned with a smile to see the approach of Pohatu, battered and weary but very much alive.</p>
			<p>"Pohatu! It is good to see you once more," Kopaka began. Then he swiftly added, "I mean, it is good to know that Po-Koro will not be left undefended in this time of danger."</p>
			<p>"Thanks to you," said Pohatu. "The power of the Mask of Shielding protected me, but not before I was stunned by the falling rubble. Still, it enabled me to survive the quake and your efforts made it easier for me to dig myself out. Too tired to climb, I walked until I found a tunnel that led to another, and so on. I emerged in Onu-Koro and made my way here."</p>
			<p>Kopaka took the Hau Nuva from Onewa and handed it to Pohatu. "This is yours. Although I believe your courage is a greater shield than this mask could ever be, Toa of Stone."</p>
			<p>"I will take the mask anyway, brother, with gratitude," replied Pohatu. "For I believe we will need every bit of power-and all of our courage-to make it through the days to come."</p>
			<h2>2. Whenua's Tale: Those who forget the past...</h2>
			<p>His tale finished, Onewa sat down with a smile. "So you see," he said, "Kopaka's refusal to accept help could have led to disaster. After all this time, has he learned nothing about unity?"</p>
			<p>Nuju clicked and gestured furiously. Matoro translated, "The Turaga says Pohatu was too stubborn to leave when asked. He should have respected Kopaka's wishes."</p>
			<p>"Seems to me neither was too everquick," Matau put in. "But the Kanohi was discoveredfound, was it not? And now they are true brothersfriends."</p>
			<p>Vakama nodded. "That is true, Matau. They are both very brave. But do they have the wisdom to understand what has gone before?"</p>
			<p>"I will tell my tale," Turaga Whenua said softly. "And then we shall see.</p>
			<p>Toa Onua Nuva dove to avoid the flailing tentacle of the massive subterranean worm. The dead-white appendage narrowly missed him, smashing into the tunnel wall with such force that the whole place shook.</p>
			<p>The Toa of Earth had heard of these creatures before but thought they were only Matoran legend. Those who mined protodermis, the substance of which everything on Mata Nui was built, had occasionally spoken of great tentacled worms that lived in the very deepest tunnels of Onu-Wahi. Some claimed they ate protodermis and were attracted by the giant piles of ore gathered by the workers. One thing no one argued was that the appearance of such a creature was more than enough to shut down a mine for good.</p>
			<p><i>Now I see why,</i> Onua said to himself. <i>If that thing weren't blind, it would have caught us long ago.</i></p>
			<p>The Toa looked over to see how his companion was managing. Turaga Whenua was doing his best to hold off the creature with his drill, but without actually doing it any harm. Unfortunately, that meant his efforts were not having much effect.</p>
			<p>"I think we are going to have to subdue this beast," Onua suggested, rolling out of the way of another blow. "Not that I can imagine how."</p>
			<p>"No!" Whenua said. "This creature has existed on Mata Nui longer than either of us. He is a link to the past. He must not be harmed!"</p>
			<p>Onua grabbed a tentacle as it went by, trusting to the power of the Great Mask of Strength to hold it steady. The worm simply tossed him aside as if his strength was no more than an annoyance.</p>
			<p>"A shame the beast does not feel the same way about us," said the Toa. "Our past he may be, but we will have no future if we do not defeat him!"</p>
			<p>A few days before, stopping the creature would have been no problem for Onua. With his command of the earth, he could have raised a wall of dirt and rock to protect himself and Whenua. But when the Bohrok-Kal stole his Nuva symbol, he had lost his power-perhaps for good.</p>
			<p>The Turaga leaped over a swinging tentacle and landed next to Onua. "Think, Toa of Earth, with something besides your Great Mask! Force is not the answer."</p>
			<p>So Onua dodged, and rolled, and thought. He remembered his decision to seek out a Kanohi Kaukau Nuva said to be hidden far below the surface. Over his objections, Whenua insisted on coming along. They had been journeying for more than a day, through tunnels long abandoned by the Matoran, when they encoutered the worm.</p>
			<p>Whenua dodged another wild swing and shouted, "Think! What do you know about this creature?"</p>
			<p><i>Not enough,</i> thought Onua. <i>It's big; it's strong; it's bleached white, like so many other creatures of the underground; it lives in constant darkness, so it is blind and navigates by...</i></p>
			<p><i>Hearing!</i></p>
			<p>Despite the danger, Onua managed a smile. It all seemed so simple, once the truth was stumbled upon.</p>
			<p>Working quickly, he used his twin quake-breakers to carve two huge stones out of the rock wall. "Guard yourself!" he shouted to Whenua as he brought the two boulders together with a mighty crash.</p>
			<p>The explosion of sound echoed through the tunnels, leaving even the Toa of Earth deafened and stunned. The worm let out a roar of anger and withdrew into the darkness below, far from the source of that horrible noise.</p>
			<p>Whenua was speaking, but at first Onua could not hear him. After a short time, the ringing that filled his mind quieted and he was able to make out the Turaga's words. "So," said Whenua, "you found his weakness."</p>
			<p>"Yes. He makes up for his lack of sight with supersensitive hearing," said Onua. "So it was a reasonable guess that he would hate loud noise."</p>
			<p>"Guess? Bah!" snapped Whenua. "It was no guess. It was knowledge gained from your experience of the realm of Onu-Wahi. It was the past speaking to you."</p>
			<p>Onua said nothing. Of all the Toa, he was the best at not speaking unless he had something worthwhile to say. Only Kopaka lived in greater silence, by choice.</p>
			<p>"Come," said Whenua, continuing down the tunnel. "We still have far to go, Toa of Earth."</p>
			<p>Later, the Toa and the Turaga sat in a small cavern and shared a meal from their packs. Even Onua, who had spent most of his existence beneath the surface, could not remember having been down this deep. He wondered what waited below, as well as what adventures his brother and sister Toa might be having far above.</p>
			<p>"They will be fine," said Whenua, almost as if he were reading the Toa's thoughts. "They can be strong, as long as they do not forget the source of their power."</p>
			<p>"You mean the Kanohi?" asked Onua.</p>
			<p>"No, I do not mean the masks, I mean true power-the power of six Toa, side by side."</p>
			<p>Onua frowned. It had not been so very long ago that the Toa of Fire and Ice, with support from the Toa of Air, had suggested the Toa Nuva part ways. Gali had protested, but he himself had said nothing. Afterward, she was angry with him for his silence. He had questioned ever since whether he had chosen the right path.</p>
			<p>"The decision was made to pursue our own destinies," he said. But he could not manage to make the words sound believable, even to himself.</p>
			<p>"You have but one destiny," said Whenua. "You owe it to the past...to the Toa who have gone before you...to see that destiny through."</p>
			<p>It took a moment for the Turaga's words to sink in. <i>The Toa who went before us? What is he talking about?</i></p>
			<p>When he turned to ask, Whenua was already gone.</p>
			<p>	*	*	*</p>
			<p>He caught up with the Turaga around the next corner. The tunnel sloped sharply downward here and the air was warmer. Onua wondered if they were still in Onu-Wahi, or if they could have journeyed as far as the realm of Tahu. It certainly felt like they were in the heart of a volcano.</p>
			<p>When he pressed Whenua for an explanation of his words, the Turaga shook his head. "I meant nothing. Besides, we have far greater things to worry about than that right now."</p>
			<p>At first, Onua did not know what he could be talking about. Then he remembered that the Kanohi Ruru mask Whenua wore gave the Turaga greater night vision than even the Toa possessed. Now that he looked harder, he could see the floor and walls up ahead were...moving.</p>
			<p>Despite the oppressive heat, the Toa of Earth suddenly felt very, very cold.</p>
			<p>"Kofo-Jaga," he whispered. "Fire-scorpions."</p>
			<p>Whenua took a step backward. "Alone, no threat. But in a swarm..."</p>
			<p>Onua nodded. In a swarm, Kofo-Jaga could bring down a creature many times their size. They thrived on heat and flame, and although they plagued Onu-Wahi, many believed they were native to the lava pits of Ta-Koro. Certainly they would follow the scent of molten magma wherever it might lead.</p>
			<p>"We have to turn back," said Whenua. "They have not noticed us yet."</p>
			<p>"Run?" Onua replied in disbelief. "From an insect?"</p>
			<p>"You are very wise, Onua," said the Turaga of Earth. "Perhaps the wisest of all the six Toa. But experience is the greatest teacher. What does experience tell you?"</p>
			<p>Onua respected his Turaga, admired him, and would have given his life to protect him. But he still hated it when Whenua was right.</p>
			<p>"Fire-scorpions felled a full-grown Kane-Ra bull, a hundred suns past. It was a day the beast still remembers with pain," said Whenua. Then he added, "He was too foolish to know to avoid them."</p>
			<p>Onua Nuva did not answer. He simply turned his back on the Kofo-Jaga and walked away.</p>
			<p>	*	*	*</p>
			<p>"I came with you to see what you have learned from the past," said Whenua as they continued their journey. Onua had not spoken a word since the encounter with the fire-scorpions.</p>
			<p>"And what is the lesson I am learning today?" the Toa asked bitterly. "That without my earth power, I must flee from the smallest creatures on Mata Nui?"</p>
			<p>Whenua stopped in his tracks. "To be a Toa is to defeat all who oppose you?" The Turaga held up a clenched fist. "Is this what you believe a Toa to be? A mighty arm to strike down your enemies?"</p>
			<p>"No. But our power-"</p>
			<p>"Is nothing. A true Toa's strength is here," Whenua said, pointing to his head. Then he placed a hand over his heartlight, saying, "And here. Your Toa power can move the dirt...Your mind and heart can move mountains."</p>
			<p>Whenua began to walk again, Onua beside him. "And is that what you used when we met the Kofo-Jaga?" the Toa asked.</p>
			<p>"My mind told me they have a sting," Whenua replied. "My heart told me I would not enjoy it."</p>
			<p>They followed the tunnels deeper and deeper into Mata Nui. The farther they went, the hotter it became, until the walls were too searing to touch. Even a Ta-Matoran, who farmed lava all day and surfed it all night, would have turned back by now.</p>
			<p>More than once, Whenua had to stop to catch his breath. Onua waited patiently, not wanting to risk getting separated from him. There was no telling what might live this far underground.</p>
			<p>"One day, I will walk along a beach in Onu-Wahi," the Toa said at one point. "And I will spot a Kanohi Mask hanging from a tree. I will pluck it like a fruit and my search will be done."</p>
			<p>Whenua laughed. "Yes. The same day Makuta decides he would like a little sun, and perhaps a friendly game of kolhii."</p>
			<p>"Why are the masks so hard to find? If we are meant to have them-"</p>
			<p>"You are meant to <i>earn</i> them, Toa of Earth. That is the answer."</p>
			<p>Onua stopped and held out a quake-breaker to block Whenua's progress. "Hold, Turaga. Do you hear that?"</p>
			<p>Whenua could, indeed, hear something, but wished he did not. It was the harsh, ugly sound of massive claws snapping. He did not need his Noble Mask of Night Vision to know the source.</p>
			<p>"The chamber of the mask is just ahead," he whispered. "But, like fish to a reef, the presence of a Kanohi has drawn the Manas."</p>
			<p>Onua and Whenua edged closer, their backs flat against the hot tunnel wall. The sight that greeted their eyes made both regret having such keen night vision. Two giant Manas crabs clashed in a huge chamber, striking at each other and then scuttling away, only to strike again. Both were easily three times the size of the Toa, and infinitely more powerful. Beyond them, the Kanohi Kaukau Nuva rested on a rocky outcropping.</p>
			<p>"Makuta's guardians," said Whenua.</p>
			<p>"They were," corrected Onua. "We Toa defeated them and drove them away. But it took the six of us, merged into the mighty Toa Kaita, to do it.</p>
			<p>"When they cannot fight others, they fight among themselves," said Whenua. "Before you came to Mata Nui, none had ever seen them and returned to tell the tale."</p>
			<p>Onua slumped against the wall, not even noticing the intense heat now. The powers of six Toa combined had barely been enough to defeat these creatures before. How could one Toa, stripped of his elemental energies, hope to win? It was hopeless...</p>
			<p>Whenua winced as one of the Manas just narrowly missed the other with a snapping pincer. "Too big to slip by. Too fast to avoid. If only the other Toa were here..."</p>
			<p>"Even if the others were near, they could only delay those beasts, not defeat them," Onua said sadly. "I can see no way to..."</p>
			<p>Whenua turned and looked up at the Toa of Earth. Onua was silent, staring intently at the Manas, his quake-breaker resting against the wall. His eyes glowed like twin points of flame in the darkness.</p>
			<p>"I have been looking ahead," Onua said, more to himself than to the Turaga. "I need to look behind."</p>
			<p>"What are you talking about?"</p>
			<p>Onua didn't answer. He had his quake-breakers running at full speed and was boring holes, seemingly at random, in the walls. Blasts of superhot air greeted him each time.</p>
			<p>"What are you doing?" Whenua demanded. "Have you lost your mind?"</p>
			<p>"No," Onua answered, not pausing a moment in his work. "I have begun to think like a Toa."</p>
			<p>"Like a Toa who has lost his mind," grumbled the Turaga. "It isn't hot enough down here for you?"</p>
			<p>Onua plunged his quake-breaker deep into the stone, then drew it out again. The tool glowed red-hot. "It is. It is hot enough for the Manas as well."</p>
			<p>"Hot enough for...?" Whenua glanced at the great crabs. They were still absorbed in their contest against each other. He thanked Mata Nui for the favor.</p>
			<p>"When the Toa Kaita faced the Manas, we defeated them with intense cold," Onua said, grinding more holes in the stone. "Manas hate the cold. They fled down here to be where it's hot."</p>
			<p>Whenua stared at him but said nothing. Onua obviously had a plan, but the Turaga could not imagine what it might be. <i>Looking behind,</i> he said...Whenua sifted through his memories, but he could find nothing that explained this strange behavior. Still, it was not the first time he had questioned the wisdom of a Toa, and he had been wrong before.</p>
			<p>Onua glanced at Whenua's puzzled expression from the corner of his eye and laughed softly. "Come now, Turaga. You, who always say I should not forget the past? Think-what else do we know that loves the heat?"</p>
			<p>As he said this, Onua found what he was seeking. His quake-breaker burst open a lava pocket and molten magma began to pour into the tunnel, heading slowly but surely for the Manas' chamber. Whenua leaped high in the air and wrapped his arms around the Toa's neck.</p>
			<p>"Of course!" he proclaimed happily. "I should have remembered myself. But will it work?"</p>
			<p>"If it doesn't, I do not think we will return to tell about the attempt," replied Onua. "If the lava doesn't get us, the Manas most certainly will."</p>
			<p>The Toa calculated there was little time. The lava was seeping closer and closer to the Manas. As soon as they noticed its approach, they were bound to spot the Toa and Turaga and charge. If he had been wrong about what other creatures might be living in this furnace...or if it took them too long to reach here...</p>
			<p>"Onua! They are coming!" Whenua shouted, pointing back up the tunnel. Now Onua could hear the <i>skritch-skritch-skritch</i> of a thousand insectoid legs scrambling over stone.</p>
			<p>The Kofo-Jaga were on the march.</p>
			<p>Drawn by the heat and the scent of lava, they swarmed down the tunnel. Onua and Whenua flattened themselves against the wall to let the insect horde go by. Just as the fire-scorpions reached the chamber, the Manas saw the molten lava closing in on upon them. They roared in anger, snapping at the magma tide, backing away toward where the Kanohi waited.</p>
			<p>If the lava was too much for the Manas, it was like a warm bath to the Kofo-Jaga. But they had no intention of sharing their good fortune. First by the thousands, then by the millions, they moved toward the Manas, fiery stingers ready to challenge their new enemies.</p>
			<p>The Manas were creatures without fear, but not to the point of stupidity. Little by little, they gave ground before the swarm, clearing Onua's path to the mask. Their claws flashed as they struck at the fire scorpions, but it did no good. There were simply too many of the Kofo-Jaga.</p>
			<p>"It must be now!" Onua said. Then he charged into the chamber, ignoring the lava, the fire-scorpions, and the angry Manas. Before the creatures could react, he snatched the Kanohi from its resting place and dove for the tunnel entrance.</p>
			<p>Whenua watched, wide-eyed, as the Toa of Earth headed right for him on a collision course. "Mata Nui!" the Turaga shouted, jumping aside just in time to avoid being tackled.</p>
			<p>Onua Nuva struck the tunnel floor quake-breakers first, carving his way through the stone and vanishing through it. Five seconds later, Whenua heard a splash from far below.</p>
			<p>The Turaga rushed to the ragged edge of the hole and peered down. There was Onua, the Kanohi Kaukau on his face, treading water in a subterranean river. "Turaga! Jump!"</p>
			<p>Whenua took another step toward the edge, then dizziness washed over him. Heights were for Le-Matoran, not the Turaga of Onu-Koro. "I cannot!" he shouted back. "It is too far!"</p>
			<p>The Toa of Earth smiled. "Turaga Whenua, remember the past," he said. "Haven't I always caught you before?"</p>
			<p>The river carried them far from the Manas and the Kofo-Jaga to the mouth of a wide tunnel. Once they were back on dry land, Onua shifted from the Great Mask of Water Breathing to the Great Mask of Strength. Together, they began the long trek up to the village.</p>
			<p>They had been walking only a short time when Whenua paused, running his hand over the tunnel wall. Onua could see faded Matoran letters carved into the stone just below the ceiling, but too much time had passed to read what they said.</p>
			<p>"What does it mean, Turaga?" he asked.</p>
			<p>"The past," Whenua said, with wonder in his voice. "I carved these letters long ago...the same day I carved this tunnel."</p>
			<p>The Turaga said nothing further. But he wore a smile all the way back to Onu-Koro.</p>
			<h2>3. Matau's Tale: The Trap</h2>
			<p>Whenua wore the same smile as he finished his story. "You see, Onua remembered the past even when I did not. The Toa are wise...wise enough to understand."</p>
			<p>"You trusted your Toa, and he trusted you," Onewa replied. "But do they trust one another?"</p>
			<p>Vakama glanced at Onewa, then at Matau. "Our brother of stone speaks the truth, though I am sorry to say it. There is little friendship left among the Toa, it seems."</p>
			<p>"Do not be so quickjumping, Vakama," Matau, the Turaga of Le-Koro, answered. "There is much you do not know. Let me tell my tale of Toa and trust..."</p>
			<p>	*	*	*</p>
			<p>Lewa Nuva, Toa of Air, stood at the edge of a cliff overlooking the lush domain of Le-Wahi. Hidden in the jungle below was his village, Le-Koro, only recently rebuilt after being leveled by the Bohrok.</p>
			<p>He shuddered a little at the memory. The day the insectlike Lehvak swarm succeeded in sweeping away the village was the same day they captured him, removed his Mask of Power, and used one of their parasitic krana to make him one of them. He could have resisted, of course, but the Lehvak had already taken over Turaga Matau and the Le-Matoran. Challenging the Bohrok might have placed his friends in danger.</p>
			<p>He closed his eyes and did his best to drive the memories away. For a brief time, his mind had been filled with thoughts that were not his own. They were the voices of the swarm, commanding him to help them complete their task on Mata Nui. Had it not been for Onua's timely rescue, Lewa knew he might still be a servant of the Bohrok.</p>
			<p>It had taken him a long time to feel comfortable after that. The other Toa, particularly Tahu, treated him differently. Some felt sorry for him; others seemed nervous that he might turn against them. Now, when he finally felt like the old Lewa again, his power over air was gone. Once more, as he journeyed through this land he knew so well, he felt lost.</p>
			<p>That was what had brought him to the cliff. In the days since his power disappeared, he had not attempted to glide on the air. Before, he could command the wind to keep him flying. Now it would not listen to him. Wisdom said he should keep to the trees and the vines...or worse, walk on the ground! But the day he did that, he knew, would be the day he stopped being a Toa.</p>
			<p>He fitted his twin air katana onto his arms and legs, turning them into glider wings. The breeze was right. If all went well, he would soar over the jungle and land in the heart of Le-Koro. He took a step forward...</p>
			<p>"Toa Lewa!"</p>
			<p>Startled, Lewa almost fell. He fought to keep his balance, not easy with the glider wings in place. Then a hand grabbed his and pulled him back from the edge.</p>
			<p>It was Turaga Matau, looking concerned. "Word is deepwood that you are seeking Kanohi Nuva masks. There are no power-masks here. Only mountain-rock."</p>
			<p>"I know, Turaga," said Lewa. "But I have been treebound for too many suns now. It is time to ride the wind again."</p>
			<p>Matau laughed. "Is this a day for sunsoaring? Very well, then. You will find your Toa-brother on the groundpath below. Try not to hardland on him."</p>
			<p>Another Toa in Le-Wahi? Yes, now that Lewa thought of it, there was something new in the wind. The scent of...smoke.</p>
			<p>"Yes, and hot-fire, too," said Matau. "Enough to darkash Le-Koro again, if someone does not stop it."</p>
			<p>The Turaga said the words lightly, but there was no mistaking their meaning. Le-Koro was in danger again. No matter the cause, Lewa would not fail his village a second time. He stepped to the edge of the cliff, took a deep breath, and launched himself into the wind.</p>
			<p>At first, he had a hard time holding steady. Gusts blew him about like a leaf, up above the mountain and then down almost to the treetops. The smell of fire was much stronger now, but Lewa still could not see any flames.</p>
			<p>He shifted his body to try to turn right. The wind had other ideas, blowing him toward the left and into a spiral toward the ground. By instinct, he tried to summon the air currents to carry him high again. But the air would no more listen to him these days than it would to Gali or...</p>
			<p>Tahu!</p>
			<p>Of course. It must be the Toa of Fire down below. If smoke was in the wind, did that mean he had somehow regained his powers? Lewa had to know. There was no time for testing his flying. He triggered the power of the Mask of Levitation and floated gently to the ground.</p>
			<p>Lewa did not like being on the flat earth. Yes, it was better than being in the water, which he positively hated. But he always felt clumsy when he "groundwalked," not like when he was swinging through the trees.</p>
			<p>Lewa loped along the path, following the scent of fire. He could hear the crackling sound of the flames feeding on old branches. He hoped it was not the trees of Le-Koro that were burning.</p>
			<p>Coming around a rock, he saw Tahu. The Toa of Fire was standing in front of a blaze, magma swords in hand. Lewa recognized his stance. Tahu was trying to stop the fire by drawing the flames into his swords, but it was not working. His power, too, was gone.</p>
			<p>Lewa rushed over to him. At first, Tahu did not seem to notice the other Toa. Lewa had to grab his arm to get his attention. "Tahu! Trying to quickburn the jungle, Fire Toa?"</p>
			<p>Tahu shook him off. "Toa of Fire? Toa of nothing! I no longer command the flames, Lewa."</p>
			<p>A small group of Le-Matoran scurried into the clearing and began shoveling earth on the fire to put it out. Lewa led his brother Toa away. "We all face the same hardluck, Tahu. But it's no time for angershouts. Why have you come to Le-Koro?"</p>
			<p>Tahu looked at the Toa of Air. He had always liked Lewa, even if their ideas about being a Toa were very different-Lewa saw it as fun and adventure, Tahu as a serious task. But so much had changed in the last few weeks: Lewa taken over by the Bohrok, the Toa Nuva splitting apart, now the loss of all their powers. Tahu was no longer certain what-or who-he could trust.</p>
			<p>"It is...not your concern, brother," replied Tahu. "I will not be in your region long. Once I have what I have come for, I will be on my way."</p>
			<p>"If you search for something in my lands, then a wayfinder you must have," said Lewa brightly. "And a wayfinder I shall be. Turaga Vakama has told you where a mask can be found?"</p>
			<p>"Two," said Tahu, already walking away. "I would welcome your company, Toa of Air."</p>
			<p><i>That way I can keep an eye on you,</i> the Toa of Fire added to himself.</p>
			<p>	*	*	*</p>
			<p>Of all the regions of Mata Nui, Le-Wahi was easily the most difficult to travel through. The air was heavy with rain and the ground was mostly mud. The farther one went into the heart of the wahi, the denser the jungle growth became. Even for Toa, hacking through vines every step of the way was exhausting.</p>
			<p>However, if Tahu and Lewa were tired, the sight that met their eyes in the center of the swamp was enough to wake them up. A grove of trees had been torn out of the ground, roots and all, and piled on top of one another to block the path.</p>
			<p>An even worse surprise waited when Tahu tried to lift one of the trees. Even without the Great Mask of Strength, a Toa should have been able to toss a swamp tree aside. But this one felt like it weighed twice as much as Mount Ihu. After three tries, Tahu gave up.</p>
			<p>"Nuhvok-Kal has been here," he said. "This is its work."</p>
			<p>"How could a Bohrok-Kal do this?"</p>
			<p>"It controls gravity, Lewa. First it makes the trees so light that they float out of the ground...then so heavy that they crash to earth and cannot be moved. You, of all Toa, should know that."</p>
			<p>Lewa stiffened. When he spoke, the normally light tone of his voice was gone, replaced by anger. "No. I did not choose the Bohrok darktime I lived through. I do not know where the Bohrok-Kal are or what they are doing."</p>
			<p>Tahu leaned in close until their masks almost touched and said harshly, "How do I know that? How do I know your 'wayfinding' is not leading me into an ambush?"</p>
			<p>"If I were your enemy, you would be lateknowing. Better to worrythink about the Nuhvok-Kal."</p>
			<p>Tahu frowned. He could not help being suspicious of Lewa, whose mind had so recently been controlled by their enemies, the Bohrok. None of the other Toa knew that Tahu, too, had once lost a mask and had it replaced with a krana. Although he had not worn it long enough to be absorbed into the swarm, he knew how powerful the krana could be. Sometimes the Toa of Fire worried that his decision to split up the team might have been caused by the Bohrok somehow.</p>
			<p>"All right, then," Tahu said, backing off. "The Kal knows we need the Masks of Power, so it's probably heading for the same spot we are. We find it; we capture it; and we make it give our powers back."</p>
			<p>Lewa began to scale the barrier, climbing effortlessly over the stacked trees. "You are heartfeeling, brother, not headthinking. Nuhvok-Kal is not so easy to capture. Take one step toward it and you are highflying or groundbound."</p>
			<p>Tahu began to climb, but it was not quite as easy for him as it had been for Lewa. Once he slipped and almost fell back to the bottom, which did nothing to improve his mood. "Do you have a better idea, Lewa? Perhaps if we ask the Nuhvok-Kal to give us back our Toa powers, it will agree to think about it."</p>
			<p>"Think about it...?" Lewa repeated. Then he jumped from the top of the barrier, went into a roll on landing, and leaped up into a tree. "Mata Nui! What a quicksmart idea, brother!"</p>
			<p>Tahu reached the top of the barrier and looked at Lewa as if his brother Toa had turned into a giant swamp lizard. "I am beginning to wonder, Lewa, if the Toa of Air has too much of it inside his head. What idea?"</p>
			<p>Lewa was now springing from one branch to another almost faster than the eye could follow. "Have you ever seen a Nui-Jaga at a bog snake nest?"</p>
			<p>Tahu shook his head. He knew that the giant, scorpionlike Nui-Jaga liked to feast on bog snakes, but he had never witnessed it. He swatted aside a swarm of insects and snapped, "No, and what does that have to do with anything?"</p>
			<p>"Nui-Jaga very hugebig," answered Lewa from high atop a tree. Then he jumped off, flipped over and over, and landed on a lower branch. "Bog snakes are many, but small. So what to do when hungry Rahi comes around?"</p>
			<p>Lewa dropped to the ground in front of Tahu. "Bog snakes come from in front, behind, uptree, downtree, all at once. Nui-Jaga gets confused. Too many for even sharpstinger to stop. Understand now?"</p>
			<p>Tahu had to admit that this was a rare case where he did understand exactly what Lewa was saying.</p>
			<p>The two Toa began to plan. Lewa sent a message back to Le-Koro, instructing Turaga Matau to gather as many vinesmen and windriders as possible and send them to the Toa. Meanwhile, Tahu went to scout ahead and see if he could spot the Nuhvok-Kal.</p>
			<p>When he returned, Lewa was already putting the Matoran to work. The green-masked villagers were up in the trees all around, tying off branches, readying rocks, and rigging nets made of vine. Tahu was impressed.</p>
			<p>"They work hard, brother. You should be proud of them."</p>
			<p>Lewa smiled. "They learn from lifedawn that he who climbs fastest and highest will get the sweetest fruit. And...they have special reason to want any Bohrok stopped."</p>
			<p>Tahu looked around. Of the dozens and dozens of trees that surrounded the clearing, not one was empty. Even if no Matoran was visible, the rustle of branches said one was at work turning the jungle into a giant Bohrok-Kal trap.</p>
			<p>The idea was a simple one. Nuhvok-Kal was incredibly powerful, but all power has some limit. Come at the Kal from different directions, like the bog snakes do the Nui-Jaga, and make it use its power again and again. With luck, it would reach its limit. If not...</p>
			<p>"What happens if this doesn't work, Toa Tahu?" The question came from Kongu, one of the Le-Koro Matoran.</p>
			<p>"It has to," Tahu replied.</p>
			<p>"It will," said Lewa. "Now we just have to lure the Nuhvok-Kal to this spot."</p>
			<p>"We will need some clever trick," said Tahu. "Some bait it cannot resist."</p>
			<p>Lewa turned to the Toa of Fire with a broad smile. "Make sure you shoutloud so the Kal can hear you, brother."</p>
			<p>Nuhvok-Kal was angry. Its mission was to find and free the trapped queens of the Bohrok swarms, and it wanted to be doing that. But Tahnok-Kal had ordered that the Kanohi Nuva masks be found and hidden so the Toa could not use them.</p>
			<p>Nuhvok-Kal had been searching for the masks since first light, with no luck. It did not like the jungle. Too many places for enemies to hide. Not that anything on this island could threaten a Bohrok-Kal.</p>
			<p>"Creature!" boomed the voice of the Toa of Fire. "Turn and face justice for your deeds!"</p>
			<p>Nuhvok-Kal wheeled around to see Tahu, magma swords drawn. Far from being a frightening sight, the Kal would have laughed if it were able. Instead, its harsh voice hissed. "Toa Tahu! I thought I smelled the scent of failure somewhere nearby."</p>
			<p>"Then perhaps you should bathe more often, Bohrok," Tahu replied. "Are the powerful Kal now searching the jungle for scraps? Or are you just lost?"</p>
			<p>The Kal didn't respond with words. Instead, it lifted its shield and sent waves of gravitic energy at the Toa of Fire. Rocks and trees, freed of the bonds of gravity, began to float into the air all around Tahu. Slowly, they drifted together until they were hovering just above the Toa's head.</p>
			<p>Tahu flipped backward a split second before Nuhvok-Kal increased gravity by a hundred times. Stone and wood slammed into the ground where he had been standing, coming down so hard they buried themselves deep in the mud.</p>
			<p>The Toa of Fire scrambled to his feet and shouted, "Follow me, Bohrok! Perhaps we can find more rocks for you to throw!"</p>
			<p>Then Tahu raced away, heading for the clearing where Lewa waited. He knew Nuhvok-Kal was following, for he could feel his legs growing heavier with each step. If the Bohrok-Kal got any closer, its power would root Tahu to the ground and the plan would fail.</p>
			<p>The Toa of Fire's only chance was the unexpected. He raced up a slope, leaped, and grabbed a tree branch. He spun around the branch to build momentum. At the peak of his motion, he let go and shot forward like a Matoran disk.</p>
			<p>He almost missed the vine he was shooting for, grabbing it at the last moment. Tahu swung out over the jungle, letting to of one vine only to grab another. He could hear the trees falling behind him ast the Bohrok-Kal continued the chase.</p>
			<p>One final swing brought Tahu into the clearing. Halfway through his arc, he let go and landed hard in the mud. Lewa rushed over, not sure whether to be stunned or amused at the sight of the Toa of Fire as a vineswinger.</p>
			<p>"Don't say a word," Tahu warned.</p>
			<p>"I wouldn't thinkdream of it," said Lewa, trying hard to hide a smile. "Everything is ready."</p>
			<p>"Good. It's right behind me."</p>
			<p>The two Toa split up, each rushing to a different side of the clearing. The Nuhvok-Kal burst through the trees a second later, shouting, "Toa! You cannot escape from the Bohrok-Kal!"</p>
			<p>Lewa thrust his air katana into the air. "Now!" he yelled, and chaos was unleashed.</p>
			<p>From all around the clearing, Matoran slung disks and stones and branches, all aimed right at the intruder. Nuhvok-Kal reacted by reflex, using its power to erase gravity from each and every object thrown. But even as they floated toward teh sky, more came to replace them. The Bohrok-Kal spun around frantically, trying to keep track of everything coming its way.</p>
			<p>Lewa waved to get Tahu's attention. "Brother! I can quicksteal his krana-kal!"</p>
			<p>Tahu shouted, "No! Wait!" but it was too late. Lewa had already broken into a run, leaped...and went crashing into the ground when Nuhvok-Kal's power struck him. He lay at the Bohrok-Kal's feet, pinned to the ground by the crushing weight of gravity.</p>
			<p>Tahu started forward to rescue him...then paused. What if Lewa was still being controlled by the Bohrok? What if this was all a trick? Could he trust a Toa who had been a part of the swarm such a short time ago? The whole trap had been Lewa's idea...but who was meant to be caught in the snare?</p>
			<p>All of this ran through the Toa of Fire's mind in an instant. His answer came to him even more quickly. He could not-would not-turn his back on a brother Toa, no matter what.</p>
			<p>He charged. Nuhvok-Kal turned to face him and unleashed his devastating power. But Tahu was already gone, leaping and spinning in the air, striking the falling stones with his magma swords. One rock crashed into another, sending it hurtling into a third, all moving too fast for even the Bohrok-Kal's eyes to follow. No sooner did the Kal send its power against one stone than it was ricocheting off of three more, all scattering in different directions.</p>
			<p>In all of this, Lewa was not forgotten. Tahu hit the ground, grabbed the Toa of air, and carried him to the safety of the trees. "Stay here!" he ordered. "I will deal with the Kal."</p>
			<p>But Nuhvok-Kal had had enough. As Lewa had predicted, the constant rain of rock and wood and the effort to stop it all had exhausted the Bohrok-Kal's power. It stumbled into the jungle, using its last reserves to bring trees down behind it to slow pursuit.</p>
			<p>Tahu started after him, but Lewa called, "Wait, Tahu. Let it go. There will be another clashtime to settle with the Kal."</p>
			<p>The Toa of Fire wanted to argue...but hadn't he just realized he had to trust Lewa? He turned back and said, "You may be right. Are you ready to travel? We have Kanohi Masks to find, after all, my brother."</p>
			<p>Together, the two Toa headed into the jungle, Tahu walking, Lewa swinging through the trees. "How can you groudwalk, Tahu, now that you have vineswung?"</p>
			<p>"I leave the trees to you, brother. And if you ever tell anyone about that, I'll-"</p>
			<p>"Our secret," answered Lewa. "Heartswear. But next time, work on that hardland, brother..."</p>
			<p>Then the Toa of Air's laughter could be heard all over Le-Wahi...and the Toa of Fire's, too.</p>
			<h2>4. Nokama's Tale: Beneath the Surface</h2>
			<p>Vakama laughed, his whole body shaking. "Tahu swinging through the trees? No wonder he was in such a foul mood when he returned to Ta-Koro that day."</p>
			<p>Nuju ran through a complicated series of gestures. Matoro translated, "Perhaps it did the Toa of Fire some good to see the world the way Lewa sees it."</p>
			<p>"They have been good Toa brothers since then," said Matau. "All doubtfear is gone, it seems."</p>
			<p>"Perhaps, Matau," said Onewa. "But if we make the wrong decision...if we tell the Toa all that has gone before...then won't they 'doubtfear' us? We have kept this from them for so long, why would they ever trust us again?"</p>
			<p>Nokama rose to her feet. "Brothers, I know what it is to betray a Toa. I have done it, and not so very long ago. Listen to my tale, and I beg you not to judge until I have reached an end."</p>
			<p>The Turaga fell silent as the Turaga of water began to speak...</p>
			<p>Hahli rowed her canoe frantically through the bright blue waters of Gali's Bay. She ignored the schools of Makuta fish that pursued the boat, despite the fact their jaws could easily tear the craft to pieces. Nothing mattered but finding Turaga Nokama.</p>
			<p>She beached her boat on the outskirts of Ga-Koro and raced up the sand. Macku was on the beach, repairing a seaweed fishing net. "Have you seen the Turaga?" Hahli asked.</p>
			<p>Macku could see how upset her kolhii ball partner was and put down her work. "Yes, she is inspecting the work site. What's the matter?"</p>
			<p>"I'll tell you later," Hahli said, on the move again. "I have to talk to her!"</p>
			<p>She found Nokama up on a ridge, supervising a Ga-Matoran work team. A Bohrok squad had tried to build a dam to cut off the waters that fed the bay, until Gali drove them off. Now the Matoran were tearing down what was left of the structure.</p>
			<p>"Nokama! You have to come quickly!"</p>
			<p>The Turaga turned and saw Hahli. The Matoran was out of breath. "What is it, Hahli? Calm down and tell me."</p>
			<p>"It's Gali Nuva. I saw her on the beach, and this huge wave came at her...She raised her aqua axes...but she couldn't stop it! Her power over water is gone!"</p>
			<p>Nokama frowned. She suspected something like this might happen when the Toa Nuva symbol was stolen from the village. "Where is Toa Gali now?"</p>
			<p>"Still on the beach, last I saw," said Hahli.</p>
			<p>"Stay here. I will go to her. She will need someone who understands."</p>
			<p>Nokama arrived on the beach to find Gali stalking up and down, her aqua axes tossed aside like they were worthless fish bones. The Turaga had never seen her so angry before.</p>
			<p>"Gali? Are you unharmed?"</p>
			<p>The Toa of Water's eyes flashed. "I cannot hear the water. I am deaf to the song of the waves, Nokama, the ebb and flow of every river and stream on Mata Nui. I walk this island, but I am no longer a part of it. No, I am not unharmed."</p>
			<p>Nokama bent down and picked up the aqua axes. "Your Toa tools are not to blame."</p>
			<p>"No, my brother Toa are," Gali snapped. "I told them we should stay united. I told them there would be another menace and we would be stronger together. But Tahu and Kopaka would not listen...not even Onua stood with me."</p>
			<p>Nokama handed the tools back to the Toa. "And will raging like the storm change that? Be at peace, Toa. Remember, calm waters are the easiest to travel."</p>
			<p>Gali walked away and sat down on a rock overlooking the bay. "With respect, Turaga, that is easy for you to say. You do not know what this feels like."</p>
			<p>Nokama laughed softly. "You are so wise, Gali, yet know so little. You are swimming in my wake, Toa. There is nowhere you can go that I have not traveled before."</p>
			<p>Nokama walked to the water's edge and dove into the bay, swimming with long, easy strokes. "One day I will tell you a tale, and you will understand. But for now...come with me."</p>
			<p>Another world exists far beneath the waters of Mata Nui. Here schools of fish congregate around protodermis reefs, feeding on the microscopic organisms that dwell within. Then, without any warning, the school compresses itself into a tight cluster, in a desperate attempt to defend against a Takea shark on the hunt. One pass, two, and the cluster is shattered, fish darting every which way in a race for safety.</p>
			<p>Gali had seen this many times in her travels under the sea, but never before had she understood how vulnerable the fish must feel. <i>It is bad enough the Bohrok-Kal menaced the island, but if Makuta should return...</i>The thought filled her with fear. Without their elemental powers, the Toa Nuva would stand as much chance against the master of shadows as those little fish had against the shark.</p>
			<p>The Toa of Water forced herself to focus on the present. Nokama was swimming quickly, leading Gali deep into the night-black waters near the bottom of the bay.</p>
			<p>The journey ended in a sea cave, one Gali could not recall ever exploring. Inside she discovered that the cavern held air pockets. The atmosphere was heavy and stale, but breathable just the same. A large lightstone embedded in the wall illuminated the entire cave.</p>
			<p>"Why have you brought us here? What is this place?" Gali asked.</p>
			<p>"It is a place of memories," Nokama replied. "Look."</p>
			<p>Carved into the stone were six figures, each wearing a Kanohi Mask and carrying a strange tool. They did not look familiar to Gali, but there was no mistaking the fact that these were Toa.</p>
			<p>"Who-?" she began.</p>
			<p>Nokama gestured for her to be silent. "Who they are...or were...is not for you to know right now. But they are one reason you are here. As for the other reasons, you will find a Kanohi Nuva in this cave...and a test as well."</p>
			<p>"A test? Why, Turaga?" Gali demanded. "After all the Toa have achieved on Mata Nui, why must we still be tested?"</p>
			<p>"When you know the answer to that, Toa Gali, you will have passed the test," answered Nokama, already swimming out of the cave. Gali pursued, but a huge stone slab suddenly slammed down, blocking the cave mouth. She threw all her might against it, but it would not budge.</p>
			<p>The Toa of Water was trapped. The only thing worse than that was knowing that she had been betrayed by the one she trusted most.</p>
			<p>Outside of the cave, Nokama let go of the ancient stone lever that triggered the slab. In her heart, she wished there had been another way. But Gali would need true wisdom in the time to come, and not every lesson can be taught by a Turaga telling stories. Some only life can teach.</p>
			<p><i>I hope Gali can forgive me...if she ever finds her way out,</i> thought the Turaga.</p>
			<p>Gali treaded water and tried to think. There would be time later to learn why Nokama had done this. Right now, she needed to find a way out.</p>
			<p>She thought about the other Toa Nuva and how they would approach this problem. Onua and Pohatu would rely on brute strength and try to smash the slab. Lewa would see the whole thing as another reason to hate water. Tahu would probably order the slab out of the way, and if it knew what was good for it, the slab would move aside.</p>
			<p>And Kopaka? The Toa of Ice always said, "The trap itself contains the key to escape. You simply have to know where, and how, to look."</p>
			<p><i>All right, Kopaka's way it is, then,</i> she said to herself. <i>Assuming Nokama is not being controlled by Makuta, she wanted me to find something or learn something here. But what?</i></p>
			<p>Gali took a deep breath and forced herself to be calm. Once all worry and fear were gone, she looked around her, trying to take in every detail. The cave walls were smooth-too slick to climb. Running a hand over one, she noted that it was not the uneven texture caused by years of erosion. These walls felt like they had been polished. This was no natural sea cave, then. It was more like an Onu-Wahi tunnel.</p>
			<p>The only other remarkable feature seemed to be the carvings. Gali swam closer to take a good look at them. They were very old, made long before she or the others had come to Mata Nui. The Toa pictured were definitely not her brothers or herself, but something about them did look familiar. It took her a moment to realize it was the Kanohi they wore. The masks were not like any she had seen before, but somehow she knew what they were. And one of the Toa looked like...</p>
			<p><i>No, it couldn't be,</i> she told herself. <i>I must be mistaken.</i></p>
			<p>Seeing the Kanohi made her realize that she had forgotten the most important clue Nokama had given her. There was a Mask of Power hidden somewhere in this cave. Finding it must be the test, and once she had it, she could escape.</p>
			<p>Gali dove beneath the water and began to swim deeper into the cave.</p>
			<p>The Toa of Water swam slowly, surfacing now and then to get her bearings in the unfamiliar cave. She had seen schools of Ruki minnows, cut off from the open sea, flitting about in the water in search of escape. Strangely, though, there did not seem to be any larger fish. Didn't anything live down this deep?</p>
			<p>Further exploration answered her question. Through the murky water she spotted bones littering the cavern floor. She retrieved one and brought it to the surface to examine it in the glow of the lightstone. It took her only an instant to remember where she had seen such a bone before: Nokama's trident. These were Makuta fish bones.</p>
			<p>Suddenly, Gali felt very alone and a little bit afraid. Makuta fish were certainly prey for larger creatures, like Takea, but few made any effort to hunt them down. Makuta fish were fast and cunning, with rows and rows of razor-sharp teeth in their mouths. Although any one was powerful enough to survive on its own, they preferred to swim in a school. Together, there was little that could stop them.</p>
			<p><i>Much like the Toa,</i> Gali thought.</p>
			<p>But something had defeated the Makuta fish. Something strong enough and fearless enough to challenge them. Gali hoped that, whatever it was, had abandoned this particular cave long ago.</p>
			<p>She looked down the tunnel, but saw nothing that looked like a threat. Just the glow of two lightfish hovering in the water, waiting for their dinner to swim by. Gali wondered if there wasn't something in the waters beyond them, much larger and much nastier, waiting for exactly the same thing.</p>
			<p>Gali continued her journey, scanning beneath the waters for any sign of a Kanohi. She saw none. Against her will, she began to wonder if Nokama could have been lying about the mask. Then she pushed that thought aside.</p>
			<p>The two lightfish had still not moved the slightest bit, despite her drawing closer to them. Normally, even a good-sized fish would startle at any movement. Of course, they probably had never seen a Toa before.</p>
			<p><i>Don't worry, little ones,</i> Gali thought. <i>The Toa of Water will not harm you.</i></p>
			<p>As if in answer, the lightfish suddenly went out. A second later, they began to glow brightly again.</p>
			<p>Gali froze.</p>
			<p>Lightfish never stop glowing, not while they are alive. Which meant those weren't lightfish.</p>
			<p>They were eyes. And they had just blinked.</p>
			<p>Gali spun around and hurled herself forward, trying to go back the way she had come. But it was too late. She felt a tentacle wrap around her right leg, then another around her left. Despite all her power, she was being slowly dragged backward.</p>
			<p>The Toa of Water looked over her shoulder. The creature that had her in its grip was a monster with twelve enormous tentacles. Each tentacle had a snapping beak on the end, and another, larger beak could be seen in the center of the creature's body. Its eyes glowed brightly as it pulled Gali closer and closer.</p>
			<p>Desperately, she looked for a way out. Fighting the creature was a last resort, she knew. She had no wish to harm anything that lived, and besides, there was no guarantee she could overpower something this size.</p>
			<p>Another tentacle was reaching toward her now, trying to wrap around her waist. Using all her strength, Gali dove toward the cavern floor, narrowly avoiding the creature's grasp. She planted an aqua ax into the stone floor, trying to slow her progress toward the creature. Her free hand reached out for something, anything, to hold on to.</p>
			<p>Then she felt the familiar shape of a Kanohi Mask. She had found it! Gali grabbed it and put it on, immediately feeling the speed power of the Kanohi Kakama flowing through her.</p>
			<p>Her joy turned to disappointment. She had been hoping it would be a Pakari Nuva. Greater strength would help her wrestle free. What good was speed when she was held in such a grip?</p>
			<p>Worse, without the powers of the Mask of Water Breathing, she could stay under for only a brief time before she needed air. If she was going to put the Kakama to use, it had to be now.</p>
			<p>She remembered something Tahu had once said. "Fire never surrenders," he had told her. "If it cannot burn through, it burns around. Block its path and it sends sparks through the air, to begin the blaze anew somewhere else. Fire always finds a way."</p>
			<p><i>Can water do less?</i> Gali asked herself. Then she began to kick her legs, faster and faster, until they were nothing but a blur. Still, the creature would not let go. She increased her speed, straining for air as she forced her legs to move even faster.</p>
			<p>In a test of sheer strength, Gali could not win. But even stripped of here elemental energies, she could still be saved by the power of water. Her ultrarapid kicking generated a current stronger than any ever seen before in the waters of Mata Nui. It slammed into the creature with the force of a tidal wave, rocking it just enough for its grip to loosen. Gali seized her chance and rocketed forward. In a split second, the tentacled monster was left far behind.</p>
			<p>The Toa of Water shot through the cavern, carried forward by her momentum. She could feel some of the familiar effects of the Mask of Speed. Her reflexes had become lightning quick, the only thing making it possible for her to maneuver at such high speed. Her vision was sharper. Objects that should have been just a blur were sharp and clear to her.</p>
			<p>Unfortunately, that also meant she could see what she was heading for: the slab Nokama had lowered over the cave mouth. Now that she had the Mask of Speed, Gali could look forward to being flattened against the stone that much faster.</p>
			<p>No! Water finds a way!</p>
			<p>The Kakama Nuva was more powerful than the old Mask of Speed. Maybe it could do more than just make her swim more quickly. She had to concentrate...concentrate on getting through that stone.</p>
			<p>Gali drew on her last bit of energy and willed her body to begin to vibrate. Every atom in her body began to move until she was nothing but a blur moving through the water toward the slab. If she had guessed wrong, she would be crushed against the stone by her own speed.</p>
			<p>Seconds before she was to strike the stone, the Toa of Water shut her eyes. Her final thoughts were of the other Toa. She wished her last words to Tahu and Kopaka had not been such harsh ones. Even more, she wished she could be by their side to confront the dangers to come.</p>
			<p>Then the thought hit her-at the speed she was going, she should have reached the cave mouth by now. Cautiously, she opened her eyes. She could see sunlight filtering through the water high above, Ruki fish darting everywhere, even a lone Tarakava lurking close to the shore. She was back in the bay.</p>
			<p>Gali called the Mask of Water Breathing back to her and turned back to look at the cave. The slab was intact. Somehow, her vibrations had allowed her to pass right through the stone without injury. The Mask of Speed had been even more powerful than she expected it to be.</p>
			<p>She thought of the carvings, Nokama's "test," even her differences with Tahu and Kopaka. And she wondered how many of those things were also far more than they seemed.</p>
			<p>When Gali broke the surface, Nokama was standing on the beach waiting for her. The Turaga smiled and held out a hand. "Welcome home, Toa of Water."</p>
			<p>Gali waited a moment, then took the outstretched hand and stepped out of the water. "You wanted me to discover the Kanohi Kakama's powers on my own. You wanted me to see they were no longer the same as before."</p>
			<p>"Nothing is the same," Nokama replied. "The Toa have changed. Your Kanohi have changed. You may soon find that everything you think you know about Mata Nui, about your life here, is but a fraction of the truth."</p>
			<p>Nokama stopped and looked up into the Toa's eyes. "You are the Toa of Water, Gali. You, above all, must be able to look beyond the surface and find the hidden depths below."</p>
			<p>Gali considered Nokama's words as they walked along the beach. When she spoke again, it was to say, "Those carvings in the cave...was that you, Turaga?"</p>
			<p>"Me?" Nokama laughed. "Now, Gali, did you see a Turaga in that picture? Those were Toa. Heroes of a long-ago age. I am just the elder of Ga-Koro."</p>
			<p><i>Yes, you are,</i> thought Gali. <i>But what lies beneath your surface, Turaga?</i></p>
			<h2>5. Nuju's Tale: Place of Shadows</h2>
			<p>Nokama looked around at the other Turaga. With the exception of Whenua, all of them looked as if she had just suggested building a temple to Makuta.</p>
			<p>"Those Toa carvings should have been covered up years ago," said Vakama. "Showing them to Gali without talking to the rest of us first was most unwise."</p>
			<p>"Why? Because I do not like asking Toa to risk their lives for us again and again while lying to them about the past?" replied Nokama.</p>
			<p>"Nokama speaks the truth," said Whenua. "Listen to her."</p>
			<p>"I have been listening," said Onewa. "I have yet to be convinced these Toa will understand the tales of Metru Nui. It seems they barely understand one another."</p>
			<p>Nuju gave a shrill whistle and ran through a complicated series of gestures. Matoro translated, "Sometimes accepting what you do not understand is the first step toward understanding. Hear Nuju's story and decide for yourselves..."</p>
			<p>Gali Nuva stood on Kini-Nui in the twilight, remembering. It had not been so very long ago that she and the other five Toa had emerged from the Bohrok nest, changed by protodermis into the powerful Toa Nuva. At first, it seemed like a blessing. Their greater strength and tougher armor would make it easier for them to defend the villages from any threat.</p>
			<p>But as they began to test their new power, the team began to fracture. Finally, Tahu and Kopaka almost came to blows. Before she even knew what was happening, the two of them had decided the Toa should go their separate ways. Each Toa would pursue his or her own destiny, all thoughts of unity forgotten.</p>
			<p>At first, she had dismissed the Toa of Fire and Ice as foolish and stubborn and vowed not to ally with them again. Now her talk with Nokama had convinced her that perhaps she was the one being stubborn. Gali decided she had to try and bring the Toa back together.</p>
			<p>Her meditation was interrupted by the arrival of Kopaka. "Hahli sent word that I was needed," said the Toa of Ice. "So I am here."</p>
			<p>"Thank you, Kopaka. I knew you would not refuse my summons."</p>
			<p>The Toa of Ice said nothing. He looked uncomfortable, but then he often did around Gali. She had always insisted on treating him as a friend, even when he insisted he did not want or need friends.</p>
			<p>"It concerns the Kanohi Nuva masks," she said. "As soon as one other arrives, I will explain."</p>
			<p>Kopaka's eyes narrowed. "Another? Who?"</p>
			<p>"It is I, Toa of cold breezes!" The voice belonged to Tahu, who vaulted onto the Kini-Nui to stand beside them. "You can go back to your snow fortress. I am sure Gali and I can handle matters."</p>
			<p>Kopaka smiled. "Perhaps, if all Gali needs is water boiled."</p>
			<p>"I sent for both of you!" Gali said sharply. "Tahu, kindly stop acting like you are Mata Nui's gift to us all. Kopaka, for a Toa of few words, you never seem to know when to be quiet."</p>
			<p>"I did not come here to be lectured, sister," Tahu replied. "I have business in Ta-Koro, and-"</p>
			<p>"We three have business right here, Tahu. Masks of Power are waiting to be found, but I cannot find them alone. And neither can either of you."</p>
			<p>Gali looked from one Toa to the other. "Now, do we help one another...or do we let our pride do to the Toa what Makuta could not?"</p>
			<p>There is an old Mata Nui legend about a horned lava rat from Ta-Wahi forced to ride on the back of a Takea shark to make it across a stretch of water. They were not very good traveling companions. The rat worried that the Takea would eat him, the shark that the rat would burst into flames at any moment, as lava rats are known to do. It made for a very quick and very tense trip.</p>
			<p>The three Toa making their way along the border of Ta-Wahi and Ko-Wahi made the rat and the shark look like the best of friends. Kopaka had not spoken more than two words since they left Kini-Nui. Tahu, on the other hand, had not shut up. Gali was wishing she could have her powers back for only a few seconds so she could summon a cold rain for them both.</p>
			<p>"Lewa, of course, was worried about what the Nuhvok-Kal might do, but I knew it would flee before me," said Tahu. "After that, finding the masks was a simple matter."</p>
			<p>"So you have said," commented Gali. "Twice."</p>
			<p>"In Ko-Koro, they call it 'whistling past Makuta's lair'," said Kopaka.</p>
			<p>"What's that, Toa of slush?" asked Tahu.</p>
			<p>"You tell your tales to keep your courage warm, Tahu," the Toa of Ice replied. "What better use for hot air?"</p>
			<p>Tahu's hand went for his magma sword. Gali stepped in between the two Toa. "Enough! We have reached our destination."</p>
			<p>Tahu and Kopaka turned to look. The three Toa were standing at the beginning of a narrow path that wound between the mountains. The Toa of Fire was not familiar with the site, but Kopaka knew it well.</p>
			<p>"The 'place of shadow'-that is what the Matoran call it," he said. "Even the Bohrok avoided this spot. Is this where the masks are to be found, Gali?"</p>
			<p>"Three of them, or so Nokama tells me. But there is great danger here, as well."</p>
			<p>"You have the Mask of Speed," said Tahu. "Why don't we just race in, retrieve the masks, and race back out again?"</p>
			<p>"Too easy to speed into a trap," Gali answered. "No, we must make this journey one step at a time. Be on your guard, Toa, for we know not what waits for us within."</p>
			<p>	*	*	*</p>
			<p>The sun was shining when the three Toa began their trek. It did not take them long, however, to learn how this spot had gotten its name. They were barely on their way when the mountains seemed to close in around them, cutting off all light. The brightest of days turned into the long shadows of dusk in an instant. The warm breezes of Ta-Wahi were gone now, replaced by an icy wind that chilled them to the core of their beings.</p>
			<p>No one spoke as they walked. In this placem a whisper would have seemed like a shout. All around was cold, hard stone, without so much as a weed growing amid the rocks. There were no sounds, for nothing dared to live here.</p>
			<p>Kopaka led the way, sharing the power of the Mask of X-Ray Vision with his two companions. In spite of this, they <i>heard</i> the danger long before they saw it. It was the rumble of thunder, so loud it shook the ground, and the howl of the wind that almost drowned out their thoughts.</p>
			<p>Gali pointed overhead. Black clouds now filled the sky, where a moment before it had been clear. Twin lances of lightning flew from those clouds, striking the peaks and shearing off huge chunks of stone. Boulders flew down the mountainsides heading right for the three Toa.</p>
			<p>"The Mask of Shielding will protect us!" Tahu yelled over the wind.</p>
			<p>"No!" Kopaka shouted. "It will protect us from being crushed, but not buried! We need the Great Mask of Strength!"</p>
			<p>Tahu started to argue, but Gali stopped him with a look. He summoned the Great Mask of Strength, sharing his powers with Kopaka and Gali. All three felt a surge of energy in their bodies as their strength increased.</p>
			<p>"Spread out!" Gali said. "We need room to move!"</p>
			<p>As the boulders rained down, the Toa struck with their tools, crumbling tons of stone to powder. Without a shield to protect them, even one stone getting through could mean doom. Tahu, Kopaka, and Gali struck blow after blow, swatting away massive rocks as if they were hailstones.</p>
			<p>Above, lightning bolt after lightning bolt struck the mountains. Rocks that had taken an aeon to rise to the sky were sent tumbling to the ground in a flash. Only the reflexes and power of the Toa kept them from being overwhelmed.</p>
			<p>When the avalanche finally ended, all three sank to the ground, exhausted. "What was that?" Gali asked.</p>
			<p>"A welcome from the shadows, perhaps," answered Kopaka.</p>
			<p>"We have to keep moving," said Tahu. "We can't let a few pebbles stop the Toa."</p>
			<p>Kopaka used his ice blade to help himself to his feet. "You are right."</p>
			<p>Gali looked up at the Toa of Ice, surprised. "Did you actually agree with him?"</p>
			<p>"You do not need the wisdom of a Turaga to know that if we stay here, whatever lurks in this place will know where to find us," said Kopaka. "We need to move on."</p>
			<p>"Come on, Gali," Tahu said, helping her up. "This is your expedition. You wouldn't want to miss the next narrow escape, would you?"</p>
			<p>	*	*	*</p>
			<p>Tahu took the lead this time, while Gali hung back to talk with Kopaka. "You know Tahu does not mean all he says, Kopaka. But so many look to him as a leader, and to him that means he can never ask for help."</p>
			<p>"Then that is the difference between us," Kopaka replied. "He cannot ask for help...and I don't need it."</p>
			<p>But Gali was no longer paying attention. Her eyes were locked on the path up ahead and her expression was one of shock. "You may want to change your mind about that, Kopaka."</p>
			<p>The Toa of Ice followed her gaze and saw Tahu, swords drawn, standing before a raging wall of fire. "Toa of ash! What have you done?"</p>
			<p>Tahu did a backflip away from the advancing flames. "It was not my doing, brother. It erupted from the ground like lava from the Mangai. Perhaps your icy breath can blow it away?"</p>
			<p>"Perhaps you both can stop acting like quarreling Makika toads and pay attention!" said Gali. She pointed to a second wall of fire that had appeared behind them. "We cannot go forward, and back is not looking very appealing, either!"</p>
			<p>"Up?" suggested Kopaka.</p>
			<p>"At the speed these fires move, we would never make the climb in time, brother," said Tahu.</p>
			<p>Waves of heat washed over Gali and the world began to spin around her. She reached out to steady herself on Tahu's shoulder. "Brothers...the heat...too much..."</p>
			<p>Kopaka looked at Tahu. "You know the ways of fire. If we cannot go over or under..."</p>
			<p>"Then we go through," agreed Tahu. "Gali! We need the powers of the Mask of Speed!"</p>
			<p>"Yes...of course..." Gali said, struggling to stay conscious. With great effort, she summoned forth the Kanohi Kakama Nuva.</p>
			<p>Tahu took her left hand, and Kopaka her right. With a final glance at one another, the three Toa launched themselves at the fire at top speed. Running so fast their feet barely touched the ground, they broke through the flames and emerged on the other side, unharmed.</p>
			<p>"You see? At such speed, even the fire could not touch us," said Tahu proudly.</p>
			<p>"No...no, there is something wrong here," Gali muttered. She stumbled back toward the fire, reaching out to touch it. Kopaka rushed forward to stop her, but she brushed him aside.</p>
			<p>"Gali! No!"</p>
			<p>Tahu's cry came too late. Without a moment of hesitation, Gali plunged her hand into the flames. But no cry escaped her lips, and when she drew it out again, it was not even scorched. "It's not real. None of it. It's a trick."</p>
			<p>At first, Kopaka and Tahu thought perhaps Gali had broken under the strain of lost powers and the long trek. But they both knew the Toa of Water too well. They could hear the absolute certainty in her voice, and so they believed her words. As soon as they accepted them as truth, the flames vanished.</p>
			<p>"We have seen this once before, in the Bohrok tunnels. We thought it was the Bahrag's work," said Gali, her voice grim. "We were wrong."</p>
			<p>"Makuta," Tahu whispered.</p>
			<p>"Striking at us through our minds," said Kopaka.</p>
			<p>"We turned away from unity. When we did that, we turned from our duty and destiny as well," said Gali. "In that moment, we became vulnerable to Makuta."</p>
			<p>"But no more!" thundered Tahu. "Now we know he sends nothing but illusions at us. And illusions will not stop the Toa of Fire! Come, we will find those Masks of Power! We will make Makuta regret ever hearing the name Toa!"</p>
			<p>Without waiting for a yes or no from his companions, Tahu marched off. Gali and Kopaka followed behind, walking quickly to keep their brother in sight. "At least we know now we cannot be harmed, as long as we do not believe in the illusions," Gali said.</p>
			<p>"Yes," replied Kopaka. "There is only one problem. What if the next danger...is no illusion?"</p>
			<p>	*	*	*</p>
			<p>Darkness brought their journey to a temporary halt. Gali had the unique privilege of watching Tahu and Kopaka work together to start a fire. Once it was blazing, Kopaka went off to stand guard while the other two rested.</p>
			<p>Gali was the first to break the uncomfortable silence. "Kopaka tells me Pohatu is well."</p>
			<p>"As is Lewa," said Tahu. "Of Onua, I have heard nothing."</p>
			<p>"It is not right that we should be so uncertain of a brother's safety. We are meant to stand together, Tahu, as one."</p>
			<p>"But we are six," he replied. "Six Toa, each with enough power to defeat any menace...or at least, we once had such power. And we will have it again!"</p>
			<p>"Yes. Then we will go our separate ways again, avoiding one another's wahi, until some new threat rises to strike in the borderlands. That is the price we pay for the pride of fire and ice."</p>
			<p>"Water," Tahu said, as if it were a curse. "Water soothes and calms and lulls the spirit to sleep. You cannot understand what true power demands."</p>
			<p>Gali's eyes blazed with anger. "Toa, if the Great Beings see fit to restore my energies to me...I may one day show you what power really is."</p>
			<p>Tahu stood and walked away, saying over his shoulder, "The prophecies may say that we have to work together, sister. But nowhere is it written that we must enjoy it."</p>
			<p>The next day dawned bright and clear, but a shadow still lay over the Toa. Gali and Tahu were not speaking to each other. Kopaka spoke to neither, not out of anger, but simply because he saw no need to clutter the morning air with words.</p>
			<p>They had gone only a short distance when Gali called a halt. She had spotted a carving on the rock wall. It showed the six Toa she had seen before, this time in a valiant struggle against...what? It might have been some many-armed sea creature, or perhaps some other Rahi they had never seen before. One thing was certain-they were in a place of fire.</p>
			<p>"Impossible!" said Tahu. "If such beings ever roamed Ta-Wahi, I would know of it."</p>
			<p>"As we knew of the Bohrok, brother?" asked Kopaka quietly. "Or the Kal?"</p>
			<p>"What are you saying, bringer of winter?"</p>
			<p>"Simply that the Turaga hold many secrets. Perhaps too many."</p>
			<p>Gali said nothing, but her thoughts were on her earlier encounter with Nokama. What did they truly know about the Turaga? Was any of it the truth?</p>
			<p>She did her best to ignore her doubts as they journeyed onward, but it was not easy. As one of her brothers had once pointed out, there were too many unanswered questions about Mata Nui. Perhaps when the Bohrok-Kal were defeated, it would be time to get some answers.</p>
			<p>"There!" Tahu shouted. He was pointing up ahead, where three Kanohi-the Great Mask of Strength, the Great Mask of Levitation, and the Great Mask of X-Ray Vision-sat atop stakes planted in the ground. Although a dull gray when not being worn, still the Pakari, Miru, and Akaku gleamed in the sunlight.</p>
			<p>"Perhaps our worries were for nothing," said Gali. "Our enemy has fled. Nothing guards the masks."</p>
			<p>"Nothing that we see," corrected Kopaka. "Even with my enhanced vision, the way seems clear."</p>
			<p>Strangely enough, it was Tahu-normally the boldest of Toa-who hung back. "Something is not right here. When have we ever found Kanohi so easily? This is another trick."</p>
			<p>Kopaka focused the power of his Kanohi Akaku on the masks. "They are real. No illusion."</p>
			<p>"I understand your caution, Tahu," said Gali. "But we do not have time to waste. If the masks are there to be taken, we must take them."</p>
			<p>Reluctantly, Tahu nodded and joined his two companions. Perhaps Gali was right. Perhaps whatever had been placed here to guard these masks had fled. With a final glance at Kopaka and Gali, he reached out to take the Miru.</p>
			<p>The next instant, they were plunging into darkness, falling end over end into what seemed like a bottomless well. Tahu had noticed too late that the ground was giving way beneath them. There was no time to grab on to the edge or dig his magma swords into the walls. All he could do was fumble with the Miru and hope the Mask of Levitation would do its work.</p>
			<p>The Kanohi did not disappoint. As soon as the mask was on his face, Tahu could feel himself floating gently in the air, held aloft by the power of levitation. Kopaka and Gali, too, were safe thanks to the power of the Nuva mask.</p>
			<p>They reached the bottom, finding themselves in a cold, dark chamber far beneath the surface. All three were on alert, but Gali was the first to say, "We are not alone here."</p>
			<p>"No, brothers, you are not." Onua stepped out of the shadows, followed by Pohatu, Lewa, and Turaga Vakama. "It seems the Toa Nuva are together again, if not in the way we would have wished."</p>
			<p>"Who is responsible for this?" Tahu raged. "The Kal? If so, I will-"</p>
			<p>"No, Toa," said Vakama. "Even the power of the Kal could not tame what lives in this place. It is a menace I hoped never to face again. Even at the height of your powers, you could not hope to defeat it...only contain it."</p>
			<p>Kopaka frowned. "Another secret, Turaga? What is the thing we face?"</p>
			<p>A deafening roar filled the chamber. Each Toa drew his or her tools and looked around, but there was nothing to see.</p>
			<p>"What is it, Toa of Ice? A thing of raw power...a creature with no fear. It was created for only one purpose, and one alone."</p>
			<p>The fear on Vakama's face was clear to see in the glow of his firestaff. "It lives to defeat Toa."</p>
			<h2>6. Vakama's Tale: Secrets</h2>
			<p>Vakama stood, his eyes on Nuju. "That is enough. I will tell the rest of this story. After all, I was there."</p>
			<p>"Yes, you were," said Nokama. "But neither you nor Nuju have told us about this before now. Why?"</p>
			<p>"I asked Nuju to keep his silence," answered Vakama. "But now the time has come to tell the tale."</p>
			<p>The six Toa Nuva took up positions around the chamber, their eyes fixed on the entrance to the darkened tunnel. From somewhere in those shadows came the roar of the creature Turaga Vakama swore no Toa could defeat. But the heroes of Mata Nui had no intention of giving up without a struggle.</p>
			<p>"I will bait the beast," Tahu said. "The rest of you close in on it from behind. We may fall, but by the Great Beings, this creature will know it has faced Toa!"</p>
			<p>"Tahu, think," Gali implored. "We have the Masks of Speed and Levitation. We can escape this chamber the same way we did the lair of the Bahrag-flight!"</p>
			<p>Kopaka shook his head. "We could, Toa of Water-if not for that," he said, pointing to the ceiling.</p>
			<p>The hole through which they had fallen was gone now, replaced by dozens of sharpened stalactites. Even with the enhanced strength granted by the Kanohi Pakari, the Toa could never get safely past all those spikes.</p>
			<p>"All right. Then we stay here," Gali said firmly. "And we make sure someone regrets it."</p>
			<p>The guttural growl came again, closer this time. Onua, closest to the tunnel entrance, could hear the sound of massive claws scraping against stone. "What is this thing, brothers? Nothing could be as large as it sounds."</p>
			<p>Tahu glanced at Vakama. "Well, Turaga, you said you know of this creature. We are in great danger-isn't this usually the time you reveal your secrets?"</p>
			<p>Vakama stared straight ahead. His eyes never wavered from the tunnel as he whispered the words of an ancient text from memory. "Beware the Rahi Nui...beware the beast of horns and claws, who stalks land, sea, and air. Born to seek the Toa, it will bring down all the works of Matoran in its path. You will know it by its roar, by the shaking of the ground as it strides, by the fierce glow of its eyes. Guard well against it, or it shall be the end of all."</p>
			<p>When he had finished speaking, he lowered his firestaff to his side and stared at the ground. None of the Toa could recall ever seeing Vakama look so defeated.</p>
			<p>"Well, those were cheerhappy words," Lewa commented, sarcasm in his voice. "I thought perhaps this beast was something to worrybrood about."</p>
			<p>"We need a plan," said Kopaka.</p>
			<p>"Yes. <i>A</i> plan," agreed Pohatu, looking hard at the Toa of Fire and Ice. "Not six plans, one for each of us."</p>
			<p>"Very well," said Tahu. "We delay the creature as long as possible, while Turaga Vakama makes his escape. When we have fallen, Takua sees to it that this struggle occupies an honored place in the chronicles."</p>
			<p>Lewa leaped up to a rocky ledge on the chamber wall. "I do not think I like this plan. Let's quickplot another."</p>
			<p>But already it was too late for plans. With a roar so loud it almost knocked the Toa off their feet, the Rahi Nui emerged from the tunnel before the shocked eyes of Mata Nui's defenders.</p>
			<p>It was bigger than anything any of them had ever seen, at least three times the size of a Toa. Its shape was right out of a Matoran's nightmare. The head of the beast was that of a Kane-Ra, the powerful Rahi bull, with long, sharp horns that could pierce solid rock with ease. Its forelegs were those of the Tarakava, the marine Rahi whose powerful arms could deliver a stunning blow to even a Takea shark.</p>
			<p>Tahu instinctively cloaked the others in a shield as the creature padded into the chamber. Its body and hind legs were those of Muaka, the great cat whose powerful claws could shred solid protodermis. It also possessed the stinging scorpionlike tail of the Nui-Jaga, and a larger version of the Nui-Rama's insectoid wings.</p>
			<p>"I never imagined my destiny would be to be flattened by a walking zoo," said Pohatu.</p>
			<p>"Mata Nui is full of surprises," Gali replied. "This is not one of the pleasant ones."</p>
			<p>The Rahi Nui looked from one Toa to another, as if trying to decide who posed the biggest threat. Strangely, its gaze lingered on Vakama, almost as if the beast remembered him somehow. Then Tahu moved between the Rahi and the Turaga of fire.</p>
			<p>"Perhaps this creature is nothing but roar and bellow," he said. "Let us see how he compares to the power of Hau Nuva."</p>
			<p>The Rahi Nui stared at the little being who dared to stand in its path. Then it lowered its head and charged, striking Tahu's shield and sending the Toa of Fire flying across the chamber.</p>
			<p>Onua moved swiftly to put himself between Tahu and the stone wall, taking the impact on his own mighty body. Though neither was seriously hurt, both had the wind knocked out of them.</p>
			<p>"Question answered," said Kopaka.</p>
			<p>Lewa leaped from his perch, smiling. "I have a smartplan. Rahi still needs to airbreathe...so take away his air and down he falls."</p>
			<p>Before anyone could react, Lewa had summoned the Mask of Speed and begun racing in tighter and tighter circles around the Rahi Nui. The Toa of Air could tell it was working, creating a vacuum around the beast. In another few moments, the Rahi would pass out from lack of air and the threat would be over.</p>
			<p>The Rahi had other ideas. Its eyes tracked the green blur circling it for one pass, two, and then it lashed out with its foreleg. Lewa was moving too fast to stop when the long arm of a Tarakava suddenly appeared in his path. Tripping on it, he flew headlong into the chamber wall and slumped to the ground, stunned.</p>
			<p>"We have barely begun, and already three of our number have fallen," said Gali. The Rahi Nui turned at the sound of her voice, its stinger slicing the air as it drew closer to the Toa of Water.</p>
			<p>"You are still working as lone Toa," said Vakama. "The Rahi Nui is too powerful to be beaten that way."</p>
			<p>"Then stop warning us and help," said Kopaka coldly. "If you know something about this beats, speak!"</p>
			<p>Gali flipped through the air, narrowly avoiding the Rahi Nui's tail. The stinger struck the spot where she had been standing, shaking the chamber.</p>
			<p>"It was bred for power, not intelligence," said Vakama. "That is how we were able to...that is how it was trapped here."</p>
			<p>Lewa staggered to his feet, followed by Tahu and Onua. Kopaka gestured for them to stay where they were, then turned to Pohatu. "Brother, we could use a bit of your speed...and your aim," he said, gesturing toward the ceiling.</p>
			<p>"Gifts I gladly give!" answered Pohatu. The Toa of Stone shard the power of the Mask of Speed with his friends, endowing each with the ability to move at superspeed. "Let us give this beats's dull brain something to think about!"</p>
			<p>The six Toa now circled the Rahi Nui. As soon as it would focus on one, that Toa would disappear in a burst of speed only to reappear somewhere else. Soon, all six were appearing in one spot for an instant, then vanishing again and popping up in another. The Rahi Nui reacted as if it were under attack by a swarm of gnats, snarling and swiping at empty air.</p>
			<p>Pohatu saw his opportunity. He joined his climbing claws into a ball and flung it at the ceiling, shearing through a dozen stalactites. The sarp stones rained down on the Rahi Nui, further enraging the beast.</p>
			<p>"I believe we have upset this creature." Onua chuckled as he allowed the power of the Mask of Strength to fill his comrades. "Perhaps it can use some time off its feet."</p>
			<p>Acting as one, the Toa slammed their fists on the floor. Their added strength created a massive shock wave that traveled to the center of the chamber, knocking the Rahi Nui onto its side. It bellowed and tried to right itself, but a second shock wave brought it down again.</p>
			<p>"This is more joyfun than kolhii ball," said Lewa. "At least until we run out of ideas."</p>
			<p>"Perhaps I can help," said Vakama. His voice filled the chamber, but there was no sign of him. The Turaga had invoked the power of the Mask of Concealment he wore. "Rahi! You have heard this voice before! It belongs to the one who trapped you so long ago!"</p>
			<p>Tahu looked at Gali, both wearing expressions of surprise. Vakama, with his Noble Mask and his firestaff, had beaten this monster before? How was that possible?</p>
			<p>The Rahi Nui rose again. It definitely did seem to recognize-and hate-that voice. Worse, it could not see where the voice was coming from. It roared in rage.</p>
			<p>"Do you remember the last time we met? Or are you too slow-witted?" taunted Vakama. "You howled and roared and even succeeded in harming some of my friends. But in the end, your rage was your undoing, monster."</p>
			<p>The Rahi Nui was turning this way and that, trying in vain to find Vakama. Forgotten were the six Toa, who stood and watched as the beast grew more and more frenzied.</p>
			<p>"Vakama does have a smartplan, doesn't he?" asked Lewa.</p>
			<p>"Besides driving the beast wild? One can only hope," replied Onua.</p>
			<p>"How long have you been down here, creature?" Vakama continued, still cloaked by invisibility. "How many suns have passed above? Did your master abandon you...or is he the reason we are here?"</p>
			<p>Suddenly the shadows in the chamber grew darker still, and a cold wind chilled the Toa. A pair of massive, glowing red eyes appeared in the darkness of the tunnel and a harsh, grating voice said, "It has not been abandoned, Vakama. It has been waiting for your return."</p>
			<p>"Makuta..." Gali whispered.</p>
			<p>"But this beast wears no infected Kanohi Mask," said Tahu. "How does Makuta control it?"</p>
			<p>"There is no need for a mask, Toa Tahu," said the voice of Makuta. "It hates Toa and all who stand with them. That is enough."</p>
			<p>"And you skulk in the shadows, as you always have," Vakama snapped. "Striking through pawns because you are afraid to face the light."</p>
			<p>Makuta laughed, a truly horrible sound. "Light? There is no light on Mata Nui. There never shall be."</p>
			<p>"You have been defeated before!" shouted Vakama. "You shall be again!"</p>
			<p>"Defeated? Never," hissed Makuta. "Only delayed. You cannot stop the darkness from falling, Vakama. No one can."</p>
			<p>"We can, and we shall!" Tahu said, stepping forward, magma swords raised.</p>
			<p>"Then do so," Makuta replied. "Defeat my Rahi, and you may leave this chamber. Fail, and Mata Nui is mine!"</p>
			<p>The next instant, the eyes were gone, the chill had left the air, and the shadows were merely shadows once more. Makuta had left the Toa to their fate, sure that his victory would be won.</p>
			<p>After a long moment, the Toa heard Vakama say, "Go."</p>
			<p>Tahu, dodging a strike by the Rahi Nui, said, "What was that?"</p>
			<p>"The beast can be distracted. Run for the tunnel."</p>
			<p>"Toa do not run!" answered Tahu.</p>
			<p>"Well, actually..." Onua muttered.</p>
			<p>"They do when their Turaga tells them to do so!" Vakama's voice struck the Toa like a hammer blow. "Now go!"</p>
			<p>The Rahi snarled and started toward Vakama's voice. Gali grabbed Tahu's arm. "Only as far as the tunnel mouth, Tahu," she said. "We will not abandon Vakama."</p>
			<p>"Would you make us cowards?" Tahu demanded.</p>
			<p>"We don't have time to debate!" said Onua. "Come, fire brother, let us see what your Turaga has in mind."</p>
			<p>Vakama waited until the Toa had slipped past the angry Rahi into the tunnel. Then he stood with his back to the chamber wall and willed himself to become visible again. He could hear Gali gasp and Tahu shout a warning, but he ignored them. His entire being was focused on the monstrous Rahi that confronted him.</p>
			<p>"Come then, monster," he said. "Let us see what time has done to your power."</p>
			<p>The Rahi Nui lowered its massive head, its claws pawing the ground. Its eyes locked on to Vakama's as it prepared to charge. Onua and Pohatu held Tahu's arms, keeping the Toa of Fire from racing into the chabmer. "Trust him," Onua urged. "Vakama must know what he is doing."</p>
			<p>The Turaga was not so certain. True, he had seen the Rahi Nui defeated once before. But that had been a long, long time past, and Vakama had been very different then. Perhaps it was his power that time had swept away, and not the Rahi's.</p>
			<p>But now the time for questioning was over. The Rahi Nui charged, horns lowered and aimed right at Vakama. The Turaga counted the beast's huge strides and waited until he could feel the Rahi's foul breath on him. Then he leaped aside, turning invisible as he did, and listening for the satisfying crunch of Kane-Ra horns piercing stone.</p>
			<p>He didn't have to wait long. The Rahi Nui slammed headfirst into the wall, burying its horns in the rock. Its charge had been so powerful that, once in, the horns couldn't be withdrawn. Try as it might, the Rahi Nui was stuck fast in the wall.</p>
			<p>Cautiously, Vakama stepped away from the struggling creature and became visible once more. The six Toa stepped into the chamber and stood by his side.</p>
			<p>"Will it ever get free?" asked Gali.</p>
			<p>"In time, yes," said Vakama. "It will bring down the wall, if it must."</p>
			<p>"I would rather not be here to see that," said Onua. "We have all our Kanohi Nuva masks. The time has come to return to the surface."</p>
			<p>"You took a great risk, Turaga," said Tahu as they walked into the tunnel. "If you had failed..."</p>
			<p>"Then someone else would have stepped into my place as Turaga," answered Vakama. "Just as, someday, someone else may become Toa of Fire when your destiny has been fulfilled, Tahu."</p>
			<p>"You knew what the beast would do."</p>
			<p>"I hoped," said Vakama. "But I had to get it so angry it would forget how it had been trapped before. Whenua would say it was defeated because it forgot the past...Nuju, that it did not think about the future."</p>
			<p>The Toa reached a dead end. Above them they could see the sky through an opening in the ceiling. "Now can we fly?" asked Gali, smiling.</p>
			<p>The Mask of Levitation and the Mask of Speed combined to lift the Toa and Turaga aloft and carry them through the hole back onto the surface of Mata Nui. The Toa's quest for the masks was at its end, but their true ordeal still lay before them. For now, questions about their future as a team, the secrets of the Turaga, and what destiny held in store for Mata Nui had to be put aside. Somewhere the Bohrok-Kal were waiting, and six Toa, still lacking their elemental powers, had to find a way to defeat them.</p>
			<p>Far below, deep in the darkness, Makuta laughed. "Ah, Vakama, Turaga of smoke," he rumbled. "Your secrets will be the end of the Toa yet."</p>
			<p>When Vakama had finished his tale, Nokama walked up to him and laid a hand on his arm. "Now I understand, old friend, why you called this council."</p>
			<p>"I never thought I would face the Rahi Nui again," answered Vakama. "Had I told teh toa about that beast long ago, perhaps they would not have been in such danger."</p>
			<p>The other Turaga were silent. Even Onewa had nothing to say.</p>
			<p>"We have told our tales," continued the Turaga of fire. "And we have learned from them. The time has come to share all with the Toa. Are we agreed?"</p>
			<p>The other Turaga nodded.</p>
			<p>"Very well," said Vakama as the others rose. "I propose that we speak with them after the kolhii ball tournament. Surely nothing will happen there that will distract us from our purpose..."</p>
			<p>"We had best be going to the field, then, Vakama," said Nokama. "I am sure the Toa will have the wisdom and courage to understand all that we have to say."</p>
			<p>With brief farewells to one another, the Turaga ended the council. They walked in silence to Ta-Koro, passing only Jaller on the way. The Captain of the Guard explained that his kolhii partner, Takua, had wandered off again and he was searching for him.</p>
			<p>"Then search on, Jaller," said Vakama. "I am sure Takua has simply been distracted by some trivial matter. After all, what could be more important than the kolhii ball tournament?"</p>
			<p>"Nothing!" Jaller shouted as he dashed away.</p>

			<h2>1. The Mystery Mask</h2>
			<p>"Takua?" Jaller called urgently. "Takua?"</p>
			<p>There was no answer. Jaller grumbled under his breath, then hurried toward the Wall of History, a stone carving that decorated one side of the village of Ta-Koro. The wall was covered with the brave deeds of the great hero Toa Tahu, who had been foretold through legends long before he and the other five Toa had ever appeared on the lush tropical island of Mata Nui.</p>
			<p>Jaller reached the Wall of History. He saw Takua's kolhii stick leaning against it. Kolhii was the island's most popular sport, and Takua and Jaller were <i>supposed</i> to be on their way to a match.</p>
			<p>"Takua!" Jaller shouted, annoyed. He hurried through the door carved into the wall.</p>
			<p>Jaller raced down the steps. At the bottom he found himself in a lava runoff tunnel. Ahead, he could hear a deep rumble, which grew louder and louder as he walked on.</p>
			<p>Finally the tunnel widened into a cave. A wide river of lava flowed through it, tumbling relentlessly toward a steep drop-off-the spectacular thousand-foot Lava Falls.</p>
			<p>But Jaller paid no attention to the falls. He had just spotted a small figure hopping from rock to rock across the lava flow. The figure was wearing a blue mask and carrying a lava board under one arm. On the shore at the edge of the cave, a crablike Ussal was waiting patiently. Jaller recognized her as Takua's faithful pet, Pewku.</p>
			<p>"Takua!" Jaller yelled. "What are you doing down here?"</p>
			<p>Takua winced. He'd forgotten all about the kolhii game.</p>
			<p>"Oh, yeah," he said. "Sorry, Jaller. Hang on a sec, I just want to check out that totem." He pointed to a stone pillar just ahead.</p>
			<p>Jaller glanced toward it. "You're hopping across <i>lava</i> to look at a stupid warning totem?"</p>
			<p>"I got curious." Takua grinned.</p>
			<p>Jaller sighed. "Do you know what Turaga Vakama would say?"</p>
			<p>Takua shrugged. "Can't say exactly," he said lightly. "But I'm betting the word <i>irresponsible</i> would come up."</p>
			<p>Takua hopped to the next rock, trying not to think about what Vakama, the leader of the village, would say or do if he found out about this.</p>
			<p>Now that he was here, Takua wasn't about to turn back before reaching his goal.</p>
			<p>Soon he was only one jump away from the edge of the island. It was a long jump, but he didn't hesitate. He flung himself toward the shore. His hands scrabbled for a hold as one foot slipped back toward the lava. He felt the sizzle of heat and yanked his foot to safety. Leaping to his feet, he grinned and bowed.</p>
			<p>Jaller couldn't help smiling. "Very impressive," he said. "Now let's go!"</p>
			<p>Takua barely heard him. Now that he was closer, the totem sign on the stone pillar looked stranger and more interesting than ever. He pulled it loose and turned it over in his hands.</p>
			<p>"Huh," Takua murmured as he stared at the symbol inscribed upon the stone. It was like nothing he'd ever seen before.</p>
			<p>Suddenly there was a rumble, loud enough to overcome the distant roar of the falls. Takua glanced up just in time to see the stone pillar beside him sink into the ground. The island and its surroundings began to quake violently.</p>
			<p>"Whaa-<i>oof</i>!" Takua cried as the sudden quake knocked him off his feet. The totem slipped from his grasp. Takua lunged for it, but he was too late. The totem slipped into the lava and disappeared. "Aah," Takua groaned in disappointment.</p>
			<p>"Hurry up!" Jaller called, as the cavern's stone ceiling began to crumble under the force of the quake.</p>
			<p>A section of the wall cracked and collapsed. Lava spurted through the opening, swelling the river within the cavern. Takua gulped as the rising river wiped out the path of stones he'd used to reach the island. How was he supposed to get back to shore now?</p>
			<p>Before he could figure that out, he was nearly blinded by a sudden beam of brilliant light. <i>What in the name of Mata Nui is that?</i> he wondered, squinting toward the source of the light.</p>
			<p>It was a mask. A mask like the ones he and Jaller and every other Matoran wore-but different. This mask glowed with the light of a thousand suns. It was floating in the lava, unharmed by the intense heat.</p>
			<p><i>Only a Toa's mask can do something like that,</i> Takua thought in awe.</p>
			<p>"Jaller!" he called. "Look!"</p>
			<p>Jaller's eyes widened as the mask floated past the spot where he and Pewku were standing. "A Great Kanohi mask!"</p>
			<p>Takua leaned out over the edge of the island. He had to get that mask!</p>
			<p>The Kanohi mask danced and whirled just out of reach. If he could just stretch a little farther...</p>
			<p><i>Got it!</i> he thought with triumph as he finally grabbed the edge of the mask. Pushing himself back from the edge of the river, he sat and studied his prize, which seemed to glow more brightly than ever. He was barely aware that the quake was fading away as quickly as it had come. He turned over the mask to reveal strange, incomprehensible writing on the other side.</p>
			<p>"Wow," he murmured curiously. "Never seen this language..."</p>
			<p>"Takua!" Jaller called.</p>
			<p>Takua had almost forgotten about his friend. Glancing up, he recognized the look of impatience on Jaller's face. He climbed to his feet, still holding the mask.</p>
			<p>"Hold you Rahi, I'm coming," he called back.</p>
			<p>"Oh, really?" Jaller replied. "Learned to fly, have you?"</p>
			<p>Takua grimaced, remembering that his path of stones was now under the lava. He was stranded. Or was he? "Here," he called to his friend. "Take the mask." Without waiting for an answer, he heaved the mask across the river.</p>
			<p>Jaller caught the mask. <i>Hmmm,</i> he thought. <i>It looked much brighter from a distance. Must have been a reflection from the lava...</i></p>
			<p>As he looked up again, he saw Takua holding up his lava board and suddenly realized what his friend was planning to do. He gulped.</p>
			<p>"Are you sure about this?" Jaller called nervously.</p>
			<p>"Not at all!" Takua replied cheerfully. He grabbed a flat, paddle-shaped stone. Then he took a deep breath and flung his lava board forward. "AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH!" he cried.</p>
			<p>As the board landed in the lava at the river's edge, he leaped onto it. The motion sent him skimming forward over the bubbling lava. But he soon started to lose momentum. The current tugged at the board, turning it toward the falls.</p>
			<p><i>Uh-oh,</i> Takua thought. Using the flat stone he was holding, he started to paddle. He kept his gaze on Jaller and Pewku, who were watching anxiously from the shore.</p>
			<p>Suddenly there was a new rumble. The cavern wall collapsed into the river with a splash, freeing a torrent of lava from behind it. The lava burst forward in a huge wave, rushing down the river toward the helpless Takua.</p>
			<p>Jaller froze in horror. There was no time to shout a warning-and no time for Takua to get away.</p>
			<h2>2. Riding the Wave</h2>
			<p>Takua stared at the wave rushing toward him, mesmerized by its size and power. Suddenly a huge red figure appeared at the far side of the river, blending in with the fiery color of the lava. He surfed across the river, impossibly fast, heading directly toward Takua as the wave crested.</p>
			<p>A moment later, Takua felt himself grabbed and yanked out of the path of the wave.</p>
			<p>"Toa Tahu!" he exclaimed in surprise.</p>
			<p>Tahu flung Takua onto his back.</p>
			<p>"Chronicler!" Tahu said over his shoulder as he surfed expertly across the lava. "Sight-seeing, were you? Let's take a closer look at those falls."</p>
			<p>Back on the shore, Jaller saw the huge figure of the Toa of Fire suddenly emerge from in front of the lava wave.</p>
			<p>He watched as the Toa shot straight off the edge of the falls and disappeared. A split second later the wave of lava crashed down, spurting over the falls.</p>
			<p>Jaller shuddered with horror, feeling his knees go weak. Takua! There was no way he could have escaped the lava. <i>Toa Tahu was too late,</i> he thought bleakly.</p>
			<p>Meanwhile, Tahu surfed down the sheer vertical face of Lava Falls.</p>
			<p>Takua clung to the Toa's shoulders, hardly daring to keep his eyes open. Tahu's skill had carried them this far-but how was he going to save them from plunging into the lava at the base of the falls?</p>
			<p>Then he made the mistake of glancing up. He gulped in terror as he saw the enormous lava wave rushing toward them.</p>
			<p>Their fall suddenly stopped short. Scrambling to keep hold of Tahu's shoulders, he saw that the Toa had broken his lava board into two pieces-twin magma swords. He had plunged those swords into the solid rock behind the falls.</p>
			<p>"So, Takua," the Toa said teasingly. "Is this view close enough?"</p>
			<p>Takua was too petrified to speak. Finally he found his voice again. <i>"Incoming!"</i></p>
			<p>Tahu glanced up at the lava wave, which was nearly upon them. A translucent red force field shot out from his mask, surrounding him and Takua in a glowing sphere of energy.</p>
			<p>The lava wave thundered over and around them, but the red force field protected them from its touch.</p>
			<p>As the shielding force field faded, Tahu pulled one of his swords out of the rock. He reached up and stabbed it back in a little higher, pulling himself and Takua up the cliff like an ice climber. Takua held on as the Toa climbed steadily upward, one sword's length at a time, trying to calm the wild, terrified beating of his heart.</p>
			<p>At the top of the falls, Jaller was kneeling in grief beside a sobbing Pewku. <i>Why did he have to do it?</i> he wondered. <i>Was this stupid mask really worth it? We could all be safe at the kolhii tournament right now...</i></p>
			<p>His grief was interrupted by Toa Tahu somersaulting into view from over the edge of the falls. Jaller jumped in surprise.</p>
			<p>"Toa Tahu!" he cried with a sudden burst of hope. But there was no sign of Takua at the Toa's side, and Jaller quickly slumped into sadness again. "Takua?" he asked quietly. "He didn't..."</p>
			<p>Suddenly Takua hopped to the ground from somewhere behind the Toa's back. He was grinning from ear to ear. Pewku jumped toward her master happily, nearly knocking him over.</p>
			<p>Jaller leaped to his feet as well, flooded with relief. "You're alive!" he cried. "Kolhii-head! You could've been lava bones!"</p>
			<p>"Could've been," Takua said, gently pushing away the enthusiastic Pewku. "But I'm not."</p>
			<p>Tahu was staring at the mask in Jaller's hands. He reached over and grabbed it.</p>
			<p>"A Great Kanohi mask," he said in surprise.</p>
			<p>"It was in the lava," Jaller told the Toa. "Takua-"</p>
			<p>"This could be important," Tahu interrupted, handing the mask back to Jaller. "Take it to Turaga Vakama."</p>
			<p>Jaller nodded and turned away, ready to do what the suddenly stern Toa had ordered. But Tahu stopped him with a smile.</p>
			<p>"<i>After</i> you've won the kolhii match," Tahu finished. "Now get going, and no sight-seeing!"</p>
			<p>"Yes, Toa Tahu!" Jaller said happily. He raced toward the steps back up to the village, with Takua and Pewku right behind him.</p>
			<h2>3. The Mighty Toa</h2>
			<p>"Today is a great day for our village of Ta-Koro," Turaga Vakama proclaimed. His gaze wandered over the crowded stadium. Villagers from three of the six villages of Mata Nui were crowded into the carved stone bleachers. One section of the bleachers overflowed with a rowdy, brown-masked group from the desert village of Po-Koro, while the quieter, more thoughtful residents of the watery village of Ga-Koro watched with amusement. The hosting Ta-Matoran were scattered throughout the crowd.</p>
			<p>Three of the six Toa Nuva sat on a special dais overlooking the scene. The Turaga smiled and bowed slightly toward them.</p>
			<p>"We are thankful to the Great Spirit for his gift of six guardians who represent the elements," he continued. "Fire. Water. Earth. Air. Ice. And Stone. Our mighty Toa, whose valiant quests and heroic deeds have saved us many times from the forces of Makuta..."</p>
			<p>There was a visible shudder from the crowd as the Turaga spoke the name of the island's dark, mysterious enemy.</p>
			<p>"...and given us hope for the future, for our history's next chapter."</p>
			<p>Turaga Vakama bowed to the Toa. "Three of these protectors are with us today. Let us welcome them," he announced. "First, the spirit of Fire, Toa Tahu!"</p>
			<p>As the Turaga spoke his name, Tahu stood and leaped onto the wall behind the Toa's box. He waved his magma swords, sending a ribbon of fire searing through the air.</p>
			<p>The crowd roared with delight.</p>
			<p>"From the village of water," Vakama proclaimed, "Toa Gali! And from the village of stone, Toa Pohatu!"</p>
			<p>Gali stood, raising her blue-handled aqua ax in salute to the cheering crowd. Nearby, Pohatu did the same, giving a friendly wave with his bronze-tinged climbing claws.</p>
			<p>Vakama continued, praising all the Toa for their brave deeds. As he spoke, Tahu turned and bowed to Gali, who was still standing. "Pleasure to see you again, Gali," he said.</p>
			<p>"Thank you, Tahu."</p>
			<p>The Fire Toa gestured to the seat beside his own. But Gali sat down in a different seat, leaving an empty one between the two of them.</p>
			<p>Rolling his eyes, Pohatu leaped over Tahu and sat down between them. He put a friendly arm over the shoulders of each of them.</p>
			<p>"You two," he said with a shake of his head. "Still so ill at ease?"</p>
			<p>Gali raised one eyebrow playfully. "I think my brother is afraid of having his fire extinguished," she said, glancing past Pohatu at Tahu.</p>
			<p>"Sister," Tahu responded, his own tone just as light and playful, "against me you'd be nothing but steam-hot air, as they say."</p>
			<p>Below, the Turaga were watching the Toa's exchange. Onewa, the Turaga of Po-Koro, shook his head worriedly. "The Toa squabble like Gukkos over a berry," he remarked.</p>
			<p>Turaga Nokama of Ga-Koro nodded. "Their recent victories are a blessing," she said, "but they've forgotten how they need one another."</p>
			<p>Turaga Vakama had paused in his speech just long enough to hear them. "Indeed, Nokama," he said, glancing up at the Toa with concern.</p>
			<p>Then he stepped forward once again. He raised his arm, and the crowd quieted.</p>
			<p>"We dedicate this new kolhii field to the Great Spirit, Mata Nui," Vakama said. "And to the three virtues: unity, duty, destiny."</p>
			<p>"Unity, duty, destiny!" the gathered Matoran cried in unison.</p>
			<p>Turaga Vakama smiled. "Let the tournament begin!"</p>
			<h2>4. Winner Takes All</h2>
			<p>"Ta-Koro welcomes three teams!"</p>
			<p>Takua shivered with anticipation as the kolhii announcer's voice rolled over the stadium.</p>
			<p>A section of the arena wall spun around to reveal a kolhii goal-a large stone carving of the face of the Great Spirit, Mata Nui. Two brown-masked players strode out.</p>
			<p>"From the desert village of Po-Koro," the announcer said, "Copper Mask winners and undisputed kolhii champions...Hewkii and Hafu!"</p>
			<p>The players raised their sticks in salute, and the crowd cheered wildly.</p>
			<p>Another section of the wall spun and revealed another goal. This time a pair of blue-masked players stepped out onto the field.</p>
			<p>"From Ga-Koro, the challengers-Hahli and Macku!" the announcer cried.</p>
			<p>As the crowd cheered, Takua gripped his kolhii stick tighter. They were next.</p>
			<p>The third and final goal spun into view, and Takua bounded onto the field with his friend and teammate beside him.</p>
			<p>"And from Ta-Koro, the Captain of the Guard and the Chronicler, Jaller and Takua!"</p>
			<p>Takua waved his kolhii stick at the crowd, enjoying their applause.</p>
			<p>"Try your new move," Jaller whispered to him. "The crowd'll go crazy."</p>
			<p>Takua shrugged. "Nah," he replied. "It only works in practice."</p>
			<p>He raised his stick toward Jaller. Jaller clunked it with his own. Then they parted and took their positions-Jaller in front of the goal, and Takua in the center of the field facing the other offense players.</p>
			<p>"Play well," Hewkii said. Hahli and Takua repeated the words.</p>
			<p>Then the three of them huddled around the circle in the center of the field. They didn't have long to wait before the circle spun open and a pair of kolhii balls shot out and into the air.</p>
			<p>Takua moved instantly, lunging at one of the balls. But Hahli was faster-she scooped up the ball and jumped away. Takua spun toward the second ball. Hewkii was leaping toward it, too-both of them swatted at the ball with their sticks, trying to knock each other aside.</p>
			<p>Finally Takua saw the net on the end of his stick swoop the ball out of midair. Yes! He had it!</p>
			<p>He spun around...a little too fast. His foot hit his own kolhii stick, and he tripped and fell. The ball rolled out and Hewkii jumped forward, kicking it away.</p>
			<p>Disgusted with himself, Takua raced after Hewkii. The two of them dodged and weaved, their feet flying as they battled for control of the ball.</p>
			<p>Jaller saw Hahli sprinting toward him, pushing the second ball with the hammer end of her stick. She flipped the ball into the air, using the stick to smash it toward the Ta-Koro goal.</p>
			<p>Jaller swung his stick-interception!</p>
			<p>Hahli smiled and raised her stick to salute Jaller's defense. "Not bad," she said breathlessly.</p>
			<p>Jaller crossed his arms and tilted his head. "Nothing gets by the Captain of the Guard," he bragged playfully. He smiled. "Unless he wishes it."</p>
			<p>Hahli returned his smile. Then she turned and walked away.</p>
			<p>Hewkii had gained control of the other ball. He raced across the field toward the Ga-Koro goal with Takua in hot pursuit.</p>
			<p>With a burst of speed, Takua darted past and flung himself on the ground directly in Hewkii's path. Without missing a step, Hewkii vaulted over him. Takua looked sideways just in time to see Hewkii flip the ball into the air and kick it toward the goal. The Ga-Matoran defensive player, Macku, dove for the flying ball, but it sailed past her.</p>
			<p>"And Hewkii scores!" the announcer shouted.</p>
			<p><i>It's just one goal,</i> Takua told himself. <i>There's still plenty of time for us to catch up.</i></p>
			<p>	*	*	*</p>
			<p>Some time later, Takua was feeling less optimistic. There were two lightstones on the scoreboard for Po-Koro now, along with two for Ga-Koro. The Ta-Matoran team had yet to score a goal.</p>
			<p>Kolhii was played to a winning score of three goals. To catch up, the Ta-Matoran had to sink three goals in a row. Such a thing was almost unheard of in the sport.</p>
			<p>Takua clutched his kolhii stick, preparing himself as he waited for the balls to emerge.</p>
			<p>When they popped out of the circle, he dove toward them. But Hahli was ready. Ducking low, she quickly swiped her stick back and forth, sending both balls skittering out in different directions.</p>
			<p>When the balls hit the ground, Takua leaped toward one. So did Hewkii. The two of them smashed into each other in midair, each falling back with a grunt as the ball went flying upward again.</p>
			<p>Both players leaped to their feet and again dove for the ball. Takua managed to scoop it up just before Hewkii reached it.</p>
			<p><i>Yes!</i> Takua thought, using the stick to vault into the air and over Hewkii's head. As Takua somersaulted in midair, he flung the scoop end of the stick forward, shooting the kolhii ball out of it in a blur.</p>
			<p>But the shot was wide-so wide that it sailed right over the top of the Ga-Matoran goal and into the stands. The spectators in that section dove for cover as the ball careened into the seats.</p>
			<p>Takua was so busy trying to watch the ball that he didn't pay attention to his own somersault. He hit the ground face-first.</p>
			<p>"Ooh!" the announcer said. "I don't think we've seen <i>that</i> move before!"</p>
			<p>Takua sat up and spit out a mouthful of dust. So much for his special move! <i>I told Jaller it wouldn't work,</i> he thought in disgust.</p>
			<p>As he looked around, he was just in time to see Hahli sprint past, still kicking the second kolhii ball in front of her. She closed in on the Ta-Matoran goal and whacked the ball with her stick. Jaller dove at it, but it sailed past his outstretched hand-and straight into the goal.</p>
			<p>"Hahli scores!" the announcer cried. "Goal and tournament to Ga-Koro!"</p>
			<p>The Ga-Matoran section of the crowd went wild, jumping up and down and cheering loudly for their team.</p>
			<p>In the Toa box, Pohatu turned to Gali and offered his fist. She clanked it with her own, grinning widely. Then Gali turned and held out her fist to Tahu. Tahu stared at the ground, not returning the gesture.</p>
			<p>Back on the field, Takua dragged himself after Jaller, who was hurrying to join the other players after grabbing his kolhii bag from the sidelines. He couldn't believe they'd lost-and it was all his own fault!</p>
			<p>Jaller extended his stick to Hahli. "Not bad," he said with a grin. "For a <i>Ga-Matoran.</i>"</p>
			<p>Hahli tapped his stick with her own, ignoring the joke. Then she turned to Takua. "Good effort, Takua," she said warmly. "Nice move back there-a little more practice and you'll have something amazing."</p>
			<p>"Thanks," he said tonelessly, not bothering to look up. It would be a long time before he got over this. A very long time.</p>
			<p>Turaga Vakama stepped forward. "Congratulations to Ga-Koro!" he said. "And well played by all."</p>
			<p>The players all turned and raised their sticks in salute to the hosting Turaga. As Jaller raised his stick, the motion jostled the kolhii bag he'd slung over his shoulder. The mysterious Kanohi mask fell out and landed on the ground, rolling against Takua's foot.</p>
			<p>The crowd cried out in amazement as a beam of brilliant, clear light shot out of the mask-aiming straight at Jaller.</p>
			<h2>5. The Herald</h2>
			<p>Jaller staggered backward, briefly blinded by the beam glaring right into his face.</p>
			<p>The crowd was murmuring in amazement. Turaga Vakama stepped forward, his eyes filled with awe. "Come," he said, reaching for the mask. "We must take this to the suva immediately."</p>
			<p>A few minutes later most of the crowd was gathered around the suva, a small, domelike shrine in the center of the village.</p>
			<p>Nokama, the Turaga of Ga-Koro, was changing under her breath as she stretched her hands toward the floating mask.</p>
			<p><i>"Mapaku una-kanokee wehnua-hakeeta ah-keelahe hanoni rahun-ahk toa-nak panokeeta makuta-tahkee ohnah-koo,"</i> she mumbled.</p>
			<p>"What's she doing?" Jaller whispered.</p>
			<p>"Translating?" Takua guessed.</p>
			<p>Finally Nokama reached up and pulled the mask out of the air.</p>
			<p>"This is the Great Kanohi Mask of Light," she said solemnly. "A mask to be worn <i>only</i>...by the Seventh Toa, the Toa of Light."</p>
			<p>The onlookers gasped. A Seventh Toa?</p>
			<p>Turaga Vakama stepped forward. "Legends foretell the coming of a Seventh Toa, who would bring light to the shadows and awaken Mata Nui."</p>
			<p>Tahu leaped down from his perch on the nearby village wall. "What are we waiting for?" he cried. "We should prepare for this Toa's arrival! When will it be? And where?"</p>
			<p>Turaga Onewa shook his head. "Ah, this Toa will not simply appear as you and the others did," he said. "The Seventh Toa must be found!"</p>
			<p>The crowd murmured in amazement. The original six Toa had not needed finding-they had appeared suddenly on the island just when the Matoran needed them most.</p>
			<p>"The Mask of Light chose who would find it," Nokama said. "Perhaps it also chose who would deliver it to its master."</p>
			<p>"Wait," Tahu exclaimed. "At the stadium, there was a sign! The mask threw all its light upon one Matoran." He pointed. "Jaller-he must be the Herald of the Seventh Toa!"</p>
			<p>"B-but I didn't..." Jaller stammered. He turned to Takua. "Tell them the truth!" he whispered urgently. "Say something!"</p>
			<p>Takua knew what his friend wanted-to tell the crowd that it had been Takua, not Jaller, who had found the mask. But Takua wasn't about to take responsibility for this. Who knew how he would manage to mess up such an important quest! No, this was a job for someone responsible. Someone mature.</p>
			<p>Someone like Jaller.</p>
			<p>Takua raised his kolhii stick. "Hail Jaller!" he cried. "Herald of the Seventh Toa! All hail Jaller!"</p>
			<p>The crowd joined in with enthusiasm. "HAIL JALLER!"</p>
			<p>Vakama pointed his firestaff at Jaller. "Captain of the Guard!" he called. "Approach!"</p>
			<p>Jaller had no choice. He started toward the group of Turaga...then paused just long enough to grab Takua.</p>
			<p>Vakama held the Mask of Light out to Jaller. "It seems the mask has chosen you," he said solemnly. "Will you seek the Seventh Toa?"</p>
			<p>Jaller glanced at Takua, who refused to meet his eye. "I-I will," Jaller said. "And Takua has volunteered to join me!"</p>
			<p>As the crowd thinned out, the Toa gathered on the wall above the suva. "A Seventh Toa..." Tahu said, sounding puzzled. "But why now? All the Makuta's threats have been defeated."</p>
			<p>Pohatu nodded. The six of them had battled a series of enemies sent by Makuta, but all had fallen before the power of the Toa. The island was peaceful, with no threat in sight. Why would a Seventh Toa be needed now?</p>
			<p>"Who can fathom the wisdom of Mata Nui?" Pohatu mused aloud. "I am simply happy to take good news to the north."</p>
			<p>"Will you travel with Gali?" Tahu asked, glancing around for the Toa of Water. But Gali was nowhere in sight.</p>
			<p>Pohatu smiled. "No," he said. "She has gone to ponder her great thoughts."</p>
			<p>Gali sat at the edge of the Amaja Circle, the sacred storytelling area that was part of the island's main temple, the Kini-Nui.</p>
			<p><i>What can it mean?</i> she wondered. <i>How can it be? A Seventh Toa...It's nothing any of us ever imagined...</i></p>
			<p>At that moment a constellation caught her eye. Six stars gleamed brightly, overpowering the light of the weaker stars all around them.</p>
			<p>Suddenly a new point of light, even brighter than the rest, sailed through the constellation. Gali gasped.</p>
			<p>"A seventh star!"</p>
			<h2>6. Unleashed</h2>
			<p>Deep beneath the island's surface, where no hint of light had ever penetrated, lay the lair of Makuta. Only his glowing red eyes and the shadowy outline of his hulking form were visible as he stalked around his lair.</p>
			<p>"The earth shudders, my brother," he rumbled, speaking to the enormous mask on one wall of the chamber, a carved image of the face of the Great Spirit, Mata Nui. "The Seventh Toa has begun its approach." He sighed. "Again the prophecies of the Matoran oppose my will."</p>
			<p>Makuta paced restlessly, clutching a stone tablet in one hand. The Toa were about to interfere with his plans. And this time, he intended to defeat them once and for all.</p>
			<p>He paused beside three massive carved stone pillars. The pictographs on them showed the masks of those who served Makuta's brother, the Great Spirit, Mata Nui. Makuta touched a pillar lightly.</p>
			<p>"Has it come to this?" he mused. "Must I release those who should never see the light of day?"</p>
			<p>Makuta plunged his hand into his chest. When he pulled it out, it clutched three writhing, snakelike creatures. The kraata.</p>
			<p>"I must strike the foundation of the Matoran soul," Makuta hissed. "Their unity can be poisioned."</p>
			<p>He slapped one of the kraata onto the first pillar. A beam of dark energy burst from the pillar as chunks of stone crumbled and crashed to the floor. Gradually, a dark, terrifying figure appeared from the rubble. A Rahkshi. The Rahkshi's body quivered with energy. Dark eyes burned behind the ghastly mask, eyes filled with ruthless determination.</p>
			<p>Makuta smiled grimly. <i>Welcome, Lerahk, the Poison-Rahkshi,</i> he thought. <i>Your stinger full of deadly poison will sicken anything it contacts.</i></p>
			<p>He moved on to the next pillar. "Their duty will be broken," he murmured as he slapped on another kraata.</p>
			<p>As the kraata burrowed its way into the creature at the heart of the pillar, a long, sinewy blue leg burst out of the stone. With a burst of dark energy, the pillar collapsed, revealing a second Rahkshi. Its eyes glowed. Its limbs twitched with energy.</p>
			<p><i>The Disintegrator-Rahkshi, Guuhrahk,</i> Makuta thought with pride. <i>Your disintegrator beam has the power to crack any structure.</i></p>
			<p>Makuta stepped over to the third column. "And their destiny," he whispered, "I must shatter."</p>
			<p>He slapped a third kraata onto the column. With a deafening roar, the column shattered. A brown Rahkshi burst through the stone.</p>
			<p><i>Panrahk, the Fragmenter-Rahkshi,</i> Makuta thought. <i>The arc of your dark energy will cause anything in its path to explode into pieces.</i></p>
			<p>Makuta stepped back from his creations as a door split open at one end of the chamber.</p>
			<p>"Go, my sons," Makuta told them. "Use the shadows." He glanced at the mask of Mata Nui with grim resolve burning in his eyes. "And keep my brother asleep."</p>
			<h2>7. A New Threat</h2>
			<p>Jaller faced Hahli, gathering his courage to say what he wanted before leaving on his quest.</p>
			<p>Hahli cleared her throat. "Look, don't get mushy, Jaller," she said. "I have no time for long good-byes."</p>
			<p>"I was just going to say..." Jaller took a deep breath. "You owe me a rematch on the kolhii field."</p>
			<p>Hahli's eyes softened.</p>
			<p>"Well, then, you'd better hurry back," she said. "'Cause I'll be practicing." She touched him on the arm, then turned and walked away.</p>
			<p>Jaller watched her go. How long would it be until he saw her again? <i>Would</i> he see her again? Trying not to think about that, he joined Takua on Pewku's back.</p>
			<p>"The shadows of the Makuta are powerful," Turaga Vakama warned before they could leave. "Do not take your journey lightly. It will tolerate none of your foolery."</p>
			<p>"How will we know where to start?" Takua asked Vakama.</p>
			<p>"Trust in the mask," he replied. "Let it be your guide."</p>
			<p>Jaller pulled the Mask of Light out of his bag, holding it up. As he turned it in one particular direction, it suddenly began to glow brightly.</p>
			<p>"Hard to argue with that," Jaller said.</p>
			<p>Takua tapped Pewku's shell and the Ussal galloped off.</p>
			<p>Turaga Vakama's voice floated after them. "Remember your duty!" he called. "And walk in the light!"</p>
			<p>Gali was still meditating in the Amaja Circle, gazing outward toward the surface of the temple pond.</p>
			<p>Suddenly the bright sunlight was cut by a dark shadow. Thick gray clouds were rolling across the sky, turning ordinary day to eerie twilight.</p>
			<p>Gali stood and made her way to a plateau overlooking the entire temple. What was happening? As she gazed down at the suva dome, there was a sizzle of energy. An instant later, the suva exploded into a million shards.</p>
			<p>A claw reached out of the smoky hole where the suva dome had stood. A moment later three horrifying figures climbed out of the hole and stood surveying the destruction.</p>
			<p>Gali gasped. One of the figures swiveled his head in her direction. It banged its staff on the ground, sending sparks of dark energy arcing up. A zigzag lightning bolt shot into the air.</p>
			<p>Gali somersaulted backward off the plateau. A split second later, the energy bolt struck the spot where she had stood.</p>
			<p>The three Rahkshi climbed higher, seeking their target. But Gali was nowhere to be seen. Hissing with frustration, the trio gave up. The Rahkshi floated upward on the force of their dark energy, hovering over the ground. They fleew away, disappearing from the temple area.</p>
			<p>A moment later the still surface of the temple pond rippled, and Gali emerged. She had no idea what sort of creatures they were, but one thing was obvious-they did <i>not</i> come in peace.</p>
			<p>She glanced down the mountain. Her eyes widened as she spotted the Rahkshi in the distance, hovering purposefully along.</p>
			<p>"Ta-Koro!" Gali murmured in alarm.</p>
			<p>Diving back beneath the water, she swam in the direction of Tahu's village, determined to warn him in time.</p>
			<p>As the river she was following flowed around the base of the Mangai volcano, she took to the land, her wet feet leaving steaming footprints in her wake.</p>
			<p>"Why have I been summoned?" Tahu said impatiently as he leaped onto the village wall. He glanced down and spotted Gali.</p>
			<p>Before she could answer his question, thunder rumbled in the distance. A huge dark cloud rolled over the village, obscuring the sun.</p>
			<p>On the far side of the lake, the three Rahkshi appeared, seeming to shimmer through the heat rising off the lava. They hovered over the ground, moving smoothly toward the Lake of Fire.</p>
			<p>Turaga Vakama had been summoned by the guards as well. He had brought along Turaga Nokama, who had lingered in the village after the kolhii tournament. The two of them squinted into the hazy heat.</p>
			<p>"Rahkshi," Nokama pronounced grimly. "The sons of Makuta!"</p>
			<p>Vakama nodded. "Shadows that cower in the depths. Exactly as foretold."</p>
			<p>Tahu leaped off of the wall. "None have breached Ta-Koro's gates before," he proclaimed. "And none shall this day!"</p>
			<p>The Rahkshi didn't even pause at the edge of the lava lake-but merely floated on, moving as easily over the fiery surface as they had over the solid ground.</p>
			<p>Tahu blinked in surprise. Then he pulled out his magma swords, holding them at the ready.</p>
			<p>As the Rahkshi reached the shore, the Fragmenter raised its staff. A lightning bolt of dark energy arced from its end, zigzagging toward Tahu.</p>
			<p>The Fire Toa reacted quickly. A red shield appeared around him an instant before the bolt reached him. The bolt of dark energy hit the shield with awesome power, sending the Toa flying backward through the gates and into the village courtyard.</p>
			<p>"Mata Nui protect us!" Vakama cried in horror.</p>
			<p>Tahu slid to a stop, dazed. <i>My shield,</i> he thought blearily. <i>What happened? Why didn't it deflect that bolt? What sort of enemy</i> is <i>this?</i></p>
			<p>His thoughts faded as he slipped into unconsciousness.</p>
			<h2>8. Destruction</h2>
			<p>The Rahkshi hovered through the wrecked gates and into the village. Suddenly Gali dropped into view from atop the village wall, her aqua axes at the ready.</p>
			<p>She looked up at the Rahkshi as the Disintegrator-Rahkshi swung its staff toward her.</p>
			<p>She blocked the blow with her axes, then grabbed for the staff, trying to yank it out of its owner's hand. But the Disintegrator was too strong. Gali went flying, tumbling to the ground.</p>
			<p>The Disintegrator-Rahkshi touched its staff to the courtyard wall. A shimmer of dark energy poured into the wall, and cracks spread outward like a spiderweb, moving through the structure with awesome speed. The village guards barely had time to leap off before a huge portion of the wall collapsed into a heap of stone debris.</p>
			<p>The Disintegrator stepped closer, scanning the wreckage. Meanwhile, the Poison-Rahkshi twirled its staff,then poked the stinger end into the ground. Poison flowed out of it, turning the earth a sickly yellow-green.</p>
			<p>Tahu was finally regaining his senses. He sat up just in time to see the Fragmenter-Rahkshi walk by, scanning left and right as it went. As Tahu watched, the creature pointed its staff toward a lavastone hut, blasting it into pieces. Approaching the wreckage, the Fragmenter poked at it with the staff, shifting through it.</p>
			<p>"Rahkshi!"</p>
			<p>The creature turned at Tahu's bold shout. The Toa's swords burned with flames as he spun them and then planted them in the ground at his feet. Twin streaks of fire shot out of them, racing along the ground toward the Rahkshi. Splitting apart when they reached the creature, they formed a wall of flame around it.</p>
			<p>Tahu approached warily. He jumped in surprise as the Rahkshi suddenly stepped out through the flames, unharmed.</p>
			<p>The Toa and Rahkshi fought furiously. Tahu was matching the creature blow for blow- for now. But he could feel its fearsome power. How long could he stand against it?</p>
			<p>The Disintegrator-Rahkshi slammed its staff into the wall near what had once been the village gate. Dark energy spidered through the columns and stones. The Rahkshi turned away, preparing to retreat. But Gali blocked the way.</p>
			<p>The Water Toa held her axes crossed in front of her. A geyser of water erupted from the earth, beneath the Rahkshi's feet. The creature raised its staff in defense, but it was too late. The hard ground dissolved into sticky mud, and the Rahkshi's weight made it sink quickly until its feet were trapped.</p>
			<p>The Disintegrator hissed angrily, fighting to free itself. Suddenly there was a rumble from behind it. The Rahkshi looked up in alarm-just as the gate wall tumbled onto it, burying it beneath a shower of rubble.</p>
			<p>Satisfied that the Rahkshi was trapped-for the moment, at least-Gali turned away. She saw Tahu across the courtyard, locked in battle with the Fragmenter-Rahkshi.</p>
			<p>Tahu was fighting hard. He managed to trick the Rahkshi with a false move, then flipped it onto the ground. Then he planted the magma swords in the ground. The earth beneath the Rahkshi split open and lava bubbled up. Tahu leaped away as the Fragmenter sank out of sight.</p>
			<p>Hearing someone approach, Tahu glanced over to see Gali hurrying toward him. When he turned his gaze back to the lava pit, he was shocked to see the Fragmenter pulling its way out, dripping with lava but undamaged.</p>
			<p>Gali saw the terrible sight, too. "We must get the Matoran to safety-now."</p>
			<p>Tahu frowned. "Retreat? <i>Surrender?</i>"</p>
			<p>"This battle is lost, Tahu!" Gali insisted as the Fragmenter stepped free of the lava. "We need to regroup!"</p>
			<p>Tahu growled. But he realized that Gali was right. "So be it."</p>
			<p>Suddenly a familiar voice rang out. "Back, you foul creature!" Vakama cried.</p>
			<p>Tahu and Gali exchanged a glance, then raced toward the sound of the Turaga's voice. They arrived to find Vakama weakly waving his firestaff, trying to hold off the Poison-Rahkshi.</p>
			<p>"Well done, wise one!" Tahu called to him, leaping forward. "I'll take it from here."</p>
			<p>Gali jumped forward to join him. She sent a blast of water toward the Poison-Rahkshi. But the creature dodged at the last moment, and the blast hit Tahu, knocking him off of his feet.</p>
			<p>"Brother!" Gali cried out. She watched in horror as the creature loomed over the fallen Tahu, striking at him with its staff. But Tahu somersaulted away, then knocked the Rahkshi's legs out from under it. The creature crashed to the ground and tumbled down to the base of the wall.</p>
			<p>Tahu landed on his feet, then dropped to his knees. A faint greenish-brown scratch glowed on the surface of his mask, then faded and disappeared as if it had never been.</p>
			<p>Gali rushed up to the Fire Toa. "Tahu, I'm sorr-" she began.</p>
			<p>"It's nothing," Tahu cut her off.</p>
			<p>He grabbed Vakama as the Poison-Rahkshi planted its staff into the wall beside him. The Toa leaped away just ahead of the poison that was already spreading outward from the wall.</p>
			<p>Gali, Tahu, Vakama, and Hahli stood together on the shore, watching as the entire village sank into the lava. The Rahkshi hovered away, disappearing into the steam on the far side.</p>
			<p>Tahu took a deep breath. Ta-Koro was no more. But as he glanced around at the crowds of Matoran huddled nearby, he realized that the entire population of the village had escaped.</p>
			<p>"They could have destroyed us," he said. "Why didn't they?"</p>
			<p>Turaga Vakama shook his head. "They are seekers," he said. "Whatever they came for they did not find."</p>
			<p>"So what were they after?" Gali asked.</p>
			<p>"Makuta fears for his spell of shadows," Vakama replied.</p>
			<p>Gali and Tahu exchanged a glance. "The Mask of Light!" Gali said, suddenly understanding.</p>
			<p>"Then they seek the Seventh Toa," Tahu said. Suddenly realizing what that meant, he gasped. "Jaller and Takua!"</p>
			<p>"We'll summon the Toa to find them," Gali said.</p>
			<p>Tahu stopped her. "Don't trouble the others, sister," he said. "I will see to their safety myself."</p>
			<p>Gali was surprised. "No, Tahu," she said. "We must remain united."</p>
			<p>Tahu turned away from her. For an instant, a sickly yellowish-brown glow flashed through his eyes. Then it was gone. He sighed and turned back to Gali.</p>
			<p>"If you insist," he said.</p>
			<h2>9. Deep in the Jungle</h2>
			<p>Deep in the jungle of Toa Lewa's home region of Le-Wahi, a trio of figures wandered slowly, dwarfed by the ancient trees.</p>
			<p>Takua glanced around from his vantage point on Pewku's back. "I hate the jungle," he said. "It's all sticky and"-he paused to slap at something on his neck-"full of bugs."</p>
			<p>"How can you say that?" Jaller exclaimed. "It's incredible! Geez, is there any place on Mata Nui where you <i>do</i> feel at home?"</p>
			<p>"I don't complain about Ta-Koro."</p>
			<p>"But you wander off every chance you get, looking for stories," Jaller reminded his friend. "What about <i>your</i> story?"</p>
			<p>"I don't have a story," Takua insisted with a shrug.</p>
			<p>"Only 'cause you won't stand still long enough to make one," Jaller said. "We all have a destiny, you know."</p>
			<p>"You know me," Takua said lightly. "Always different."</p>
			<p>Suddenly a fierce roar blasted through the jungle. Pewku stopped short, trembling.</p>
			<p>Takua gulped. "Yet another reason to hate the jungle," he whispered. "Go that way, Pewku!"</p>
			<p>Pewku changed direction. The Mask of Light, which Jaller was still holding, began to fade.</p>
			<p>"No," Jaller said. "The mask says this way. Back on track, Pewku." He waited, but the Ussal continued in the new direction. "Pewku!"</p>
			<p>Pewku whined nervously. Slowly, she turned back to the original track.</p>
			<p>The Ussal stepped forward. She blinked as something-a large shape, blurred with speed-passed in front of them.</p>
			<p>Takua didn't notice. "Will you top with the duty thing and use your head?" he said to Jaller. "Or do you <i>want</i> to be jungle snacks?"</p>
			<p>"Guess I should listen to the real Herald," Jaller retorted sarcastically. He smacked himself in the forehead. "No, wait! You weaseled out. So <i>I'm</i> in charge."</p>
			<p>Pewku stopped short as a fierce-looking creature stepped out in front of them. It was an ash bear, all teeth and claws.</p>
			<p>Takua noticed it. "Fine," he told Jaller, his voice shaking slightly as he pointed to the ash bear. "You're doing great so far."</p>
			<p>The ash bear let out a mighty roar. Takua, Jaller, and Pewku shrieked in response. Takua and Jaller ducked as the ash bear's claws swatted at them. Pewku turned and fled, scampering behind a large tree.</p>
			<p>The ash bear lunged around the tree in pursuit. Pewku changed direction, heading back the other way around the tree's trunk. But the ash bear was too quick, blocking their way once more. It swiped at them again, missing by the merest fraction. Its claws met the tree trunk instead, leaving deep gashes in the bark.</p>
			<p>"Keep him busy!" Jaller said, grabbing the trunk and starting to climb. "I'm..."</p>
			<p>"Running away and leaving me!" Takua finished for him.</p>
			<p>The ash bear made another lunge, backing Takua and Pewku against the tree. Jaller swung up onto a branch directly overhead.</p>
			<p>"Just watch!" he called down to his friends. "Toa Tahu does this!"</p>
			<p>He jumped out of the tree-right onto the ash bear's broad back. But he'd misjudged his leap and wound up facing the creature's hind-quarters. The ash bear turned away from Takua and Pewku. It grunted and roared angrily as it leaped and twisted, trying to dislodge Jaller.</p>
			<p>Takua and Pewku raced out of range. "Toa Tahu does <i>that</i>?" Takua muttered, turning to watch as Jaller hung on for dear life.</p>
			<p>"Whoa!" Jaller cried, feeling his grasp slip. He had to hold on! If he fell off now...</p>
			<p>Before he could finish the thought, a sudden gust of wind swirled through the leaves. At the same time, a vine snaked out of the brush, coiling around the ash bear's front foot.</p>
			<p>The ash bear growled in surprise as another vine followed the first, wrapping around the creature's back feet and looping them together. The vines tightened, and the ash bear was hoisted off the jungle floor. Jaller finally lost his grip and crashed to the ground, landing face-first.</p>
			<p>"Oof!" he grunted.</p>
			<p>A tall green figure dropped down out of the foliage above.</p>
			<p>"Toa Lewa!" Takua cried.</p>
			<p>He bowed to the Toa, while Jaller rolled painfully to a sitting position. Lewa grinned.</p>
			<p>"Mata Nui!" he exclaimed to Jaller. "Where'd you learn to bearfight like that, little man?"</p>
			<p>Jaller rubbed his sore back. "Right here," he said with a groan.</p>
			<p>Lewa playfully grabbed Jaller, setting him gently on his feet. "Well, I'd say you're a natural, brave firespitter," the Toa said.</p>
			<p>He released the vines, lowering the ash bear to the ground. The ash bear immediately leaped up and growled.</p>
			<p>Takua and Jaller stepped back, leaving Lewa alone to face the ash bear. The Toa spoke soothingly to the creature. "Go on now, sisterbear."</p>
			<p>The ash bear hesitated. Then she turned and lumbered off into the jungle.</p>
			<p>Jaller and Takua were amazed. But now that the ash bear was gone, Lewa had other things on his mind. "Word is deepwood that you seek the Seventh Toa," he said.</p>
			<p>Takua gestured toward Jaller. "He seeks, I follow. He's the Herald. I'm just his biographer."</p>
			<p>Jaller scowled at Takua, but Lewa didn't notice. "If Toa Lewa helped on your search, might he be a spiritlift?"</p>
			<p>Takua and Jaller glanced at each other in amazement. The mighty Toa wanted to travel with <i>them</i>?</p>
			<p>"You?" Takua said. "With us?"</p>
			<p>"We'd be honored to have you walk with us!" Jaller added eagerly.</p>
			<p>Lewa glanced upward. "Walk?" he said. "Not never! If you ride with me, there'll be no footwalkin'..."</p>
			<p>There was a <i>whoosh</i> from overhead. A giant, hawklike Gukko bird swooped out of the trees and hovered above them. Lewa grinned at the two Matoran.</p>
			<p>"Just airflyin'," he finished. "Ever windfly a Gukko bird?"</p>
			<p>Jaller shook his head, his eyes wide. But Takua shrugged. "I've been a second," he said. "But I've never flown one myself."</p>
			<p>Lewa grabbed Takua and Jaller and tossed them up onto the Gukko. They landed sitting right behind the bird's head, with Takua in the front.</p>
			<p>"Then today's for quicklearnin'," Lewa declared as the Matoran yelped in surprise. "Stay sharp, and follow-well!" He spread his arms, the air katana blades he carried locking into his shoulders. Then he leaped into the air.</p>
			<p>As the Gukko wheeled to follow the Toa, Takua glanced down and noticed Pewku watching anxiously from the ground. "Sorry, Pewku," he called to her gently. "No room. Go on home."</p>
			<p>Pewku's head drooped sadly. She let out a soft whine as the Gukko bird flapped through the treetops and disappeared.</p>
			<p>Takua and Jaller soon got the hang of following the Gukko's movements as it swooped and glided through the air after Lewa. "Hey, I'm good at this!" Takua cried out as the bird dove through a grove of trees. Takua ducked just in time, but Jaller ended up with a mouthful of leaves.</p>
			<p>He spit them out. "As compared to what?" he asked Takua.</p>
			<p>The Gukko veered again. Nearby, Lewa did an amazing loop-the-loop in midair, then swooped over to glide along beside the bird and its passengers. "Ha!" the Toa exclaimed. "I was so eager to join your search, I forgot I'm not the wayfinder. Herald, do the honors!"</p>
			<p>Jaller raised the mask. It glowed brightly, leading them up through the jungle canopy and over the treetops toward the steep, snow-covered peaks of the Ko-Wahi region, where Kopaka's people made their home.</p>
			<p>Soon they reached a snowy plateau. In the background, sheer cliffs rose into ice-covered peaks. The Gukko glided to a landing, stopping abruptly as its feet touched down. Taken by surprise, Takua and Jaller flipped forward over its head, landing face-first in the snow.</p>
			<p>Jaller sat up and glared at Takua. Takua shrugged. "What?" he said. "We're here."</p>
			<p>Jaller raised the Mask of Light and spun slowly in place. The mask brightened as he faced a ravine between two snowcapped peaks.</p>
			<p>"Hey!" Jaller said to Takua in surprise as the Gukko flew off. "You even kept us on the right path. Not bad for a kolhii-head."</p>
			<p>He glanced around, looking for Lewa. The Toa was standing at the cliff's edge, looking out over the jungle with an expression of concentration. As Takua and Jaller stepped toward him, they heard the faint sound of tribal drums in the distance.</p>
			<p>Lewa turned toward them, looking unusually solemn. "The drums of Le-Koro bring a sorrybad story," he told them. "Your village has...fallen. To Rahkshi, the Makuta sons."</p>
			<p>Jaller could hardly believe his ears. "My village, in trouble?" he cried, stricken. "I should have been there! I must return!"</p>
			<p>"Sorry, firespitter," Lewa said gently. "Pastlate to help now. The mask most needs you."</p>
			<p>Jaller turned, shoving the mask into Takua's hands. "Takua will continue in my place."</p>
			<p>"Uh-uh, no way!" Takua said quickly. "You accepted this duty."</p>
			<p>"I accepted <i>your</i> duty!" Jaller shot back.</p>
			<p>"Stop!" Lewa ordered sternly. He stepped between them. "What's this dutyquarrel? We <i>all</i> have a duty to Mata Nui. No time to infight."</p>
			<p>Takua and Jaller exchanged a guilty glance. "I must go be with the Toa," Lewa said. "But then I'll go to your village, Jaller. Heartpromise."</p>
			<p>Jaller bowed to the Air Toa. "I...can't thank you enough, Toa."</p>
			<p>Lewa leaped into the air and glided out of sight. Jaller grabbed the mask back from Takua and headed for the ravine. Takua shrugged and followed.</p>
			<h2>10. Lost</h2>
			<p>Dark storm clouds gathered over the mountain peaks as Jaller and Takua struggled through the snowdrifts. On a ridge overlooking the valley, a dark shape watched their progress. Jaller and Takua never noticed it as they clambered through the icy drifts.</p>
			<p>Takua paused as the whirling snow cleared just long enough to offer him a glimpse of an odd-looking stone with writing carved on it. "Stop!" he called breathlessly to Jaller. "Does something look familiar here?"</p>
			<p>"You mean besides everything?" Jaller panted, gazing around at the whiteout conditions.</p>
			<p>"I mean <i>this</i>." Takua pointed at the stone. "We've passed this at least a million times. And look..." He pointed again, this time to footprints in the snow leading off ahead of them. "Those are either our footprints or the steps to a Le-Matoran dance."</p>
			<p>"Well, don't blame me!" Jaller said. "I'm following the mask."</p>
			<p>"Fine! Let's all freeze to death because the mask says to," Takua retorted.</p>
			<p>Jaller turned and kept walking. Neither he nor Takua noticed as the mask gradually dimmed. "Well, <i>maybe</i> our path would be straighter if the <i>real</i> Herald had the mask," Jaller snapped.</p>
			<p>"The real Herald <i>has</i> the mask," Takua returned. "I couldn't find water if I fell out of a canoe."</p>
			<p>"Well, what do you think <i>I</i> can find?" Jaller said. "I-<i>oof</i>!"</p>
			<p>His words cut off as he slammed into a tall white figure, almost hidden in the blowing snow.</p>
			<p>Takua's eyes widened as the ominous shapes of six white creatures towered over them. "Uh, so far you're good at big scary...<i>Bohrok</i>!"</p>
			<p>Jaller's heart was pounding with fright. The Bohrok were among the most terrifying creatures ever to threaten Mata Nui. But these...why did they just stand there, as still as the mountain itself?</p>
			<p>"Frozen," he murmured as he realized the truth. "What could do this to them?"</p>
			<p>Suddenly one of the Bohrok lurched forward. Jaller and Takua jumped in fright. The Bohrok crashed to the ground...revealing a very different figure standing behind it.</p>
			<p>"Kopaka!" Jaller exclaimed. "Toa of Ice! H-how did you find us?"</p>
			<p>"It was <i>you</i> who were following me," Kopaka replied, his icy voice full of suspicion.</p>
			<p>Jaller kept a nervous eye on the Toa's ice blade. "We were?" Jaller said.</p>
			<p>Kopaka finally put his blade away. He turned and walked off without another word.</p>
			<p>Takua and Jaller exchanged a glance. Both were thinking the same thing-the Toa of Ice would make a very useful guide in this frozen wasteland. They hurried after him.</p>
			<p>"We didn't mean to," Takua called after Kopaka, struggling to keep up with him in the deep snow. "We were lost."</p>
			<p>"We're on a mission!" Jaller added, holding up the Mask of Light. "We've been sent to find the Seventh Toa," he said, the words tumbling out of him eagerly. "You see, Takua here was in the tunnel where the lava break is, where he's not <i>supposed</i> to be, by the way, and I told him-"</p>
			<p>Kopaka halted, silencing him with an up-raised hand.</p>
			<p>"Ulp," Jaller blurted. "Sorry."</p>
			<p>"You are the Chronicler," Kopaka said to Takua.</p>
			<p>Takua was a bit unnerved by the Toa's icy gaze. "Uh, yes," he stammered.</p>
			<p>Kopaka looked thoughtful. "Your stories have aided the Toa in the past," he said. "I will take you to my village of Ko-Koro. State your purpose to the Turaga."</p>
			<p>He strode off, not bothering to look and see if they were following.</p>
			<p>	*	*	*</p>
			<p>At the main temple, Lewa glided to a landing in front of Tahu and Gali. He held up his fist, which Tahu clanked with his own in greeting.</p>
			<p>"Ta-Koro is gone, Lewa," Tahu said heavily. "Buried by the very lava that sustained. it."</p>
			<p>Gali's gaze rested on Tahu. She reached out to touch the scratch on his mask, which appeared to be spreading. "Tahu..." she began.</p>
			<p>Tahu brushed away her hand. "You worry about scratches?" he said angrily to Gali. "My village is <i>gone</i>! Your power was nothing! My power was..." He sighed in defeat. "Nothing."</p>
			<p>Lewa put a hand on Tahu's shoulder. "We are samehearted, brother. And that heart will quicken us to stop the evilspread."</p>
			<p>"But first we must be united," Gali said. "Together we are strong."</p>
			<p>Without answering either of them, Tahu turned and stalked away.</p>
			<h2>11. Deep Freeze</h2>
			<p>Takua, Jaller, and Kopaka rounded a hill of ice. Before them spread a snowy valley. Steep cliffs rose on the far side. Set into one of the cliffs was a village, accessible only by a bridge of ice.</p>
			<p>But something was wrong. The village wall had fallen. Huts were in shambles, and smoke rose from the ruins. There was no one in sight.</p>
			<p>Jaller and Takua raced toward the ice bridge, wanting to help.</p>
			<p>Kopaka glanced up as a dark shadow fell over the valley. "Stop!" he shouted.</p>
			<p>Takua and Jaller skidded to a halt. The bridge was just ahead, stretching over a deep chasm. From below the lip of the gorge, three terrifying figures hovered into view.</p>
			<p>The trio of Rahkshi landed in front of the awestruck Matoran, unfolding their legs to stand at full height. Takua and Jaller goggled up at the hideous creatures, frozen with fear.</p>
			<p>The Fragmenter-Rahkshi planted its staff in the snow. A zigzagging bolt arced into the air, then down toward the helpless pair.</p>
			<p>Kopaka slid toward them, his shield up. The ice shield deflected the bolt, its energy knocking the Toa backward. The bolt blasted back toward the Rahkshi, shooting a plume of snow into the air as the creatures dove for safety.</p>
			<p>The Fragmenter let out an angry roar. Kopaka climbed to his feet and raced away with Takua and Jaller close behind him. The Rahkshi chased them, launching bolt after bolt of energy, which rained down all around the fleeing trio.</p>
			<p>Suddenly Kopaka stopped short, flinging out his blade to block the Matoran's path. Takua and Jaller slid to a stop, realizing that they were about to race right off of a steep cliff that dropped away into a treacherous ravine.</p>
			<p>"Prepre," Kopaka ordered, turning to face their pursuers.</p>
			<p>Jaller and Takua blinked, confused, as the Toa tossed his shield facedown onto the snow beside them. Suddenly realizing what Kopaka meant for them to do, Jaller shook his head. "The Captain of the Guard never runs awaaaaaaay!"</p>
			<p>His last word was lost in a cry of terror as Takua pushed him onto the shield and jumped aboard himself. The momentum carried the shield skidding toward the cliff. It toppled on the edge, then tipped down, sliding faster and faster along the impossibly steep incline.</p>
			<p>Kopaka hardly heard their fading screams. He faced the Rahkshi as they closed in on him.</p>
			<p>The Fragmenter-Rahkshi sent yet another bolt of energy arcing toward him. Kopaka somersaulted away, dodging the bolt. As he came down, he tossed his twin blades onto the snow. He landed on them, turning them into power ice skates, on which he glided down the cliff face.</p>
			<p>The Rahkshi watched him go, their burning eyes sparking with anger.</p>
			<p>	*	*	*</p>
			<p>Jaller clutched the edge of the shield-sled, now too terrified to scream. The shield sped down the cliff at an awesome speed.</p>
			<p>He was relieved to see Kopaka appear beside them. As they neared the bottom of the slope, Takua pointed ahead. "Dead end!" he cried.</p>
			<p>The base of the cliff sloped into a sheer rock face. Only a narrow ravine leading to a small lake offered a path through.</p>
			<p>Kopaka zoomed ahead of the shield. Bending his knees, he reached back and grabbed the front edge, pulling it behind him as he veered into the ravine.</p>
			<p>"Whoaaaaa!" Takua and Jaller yelled as they felt themselves skid up the ravine wall.</p>
			<p>But Kopaka yanked the shield back onto the icy path. They sped down the ravine.</p>
			<p><i>BOOM!</i> An arc of dark energy smashed into the snow right in Kopaka's path. The shock waves knocked him right off his feet, sending him rolling into the snow.</p>
			<p>The shield flipped over, dumping Takua and Jaller as well. They tumbled head over heels, landing on the very edge of the lake.</p>
			<p>The Fragmenter-Rahkshi hissed triumphantly as it hovered down toward him. The other two Rahkshi were right behind the first.</p>
			<p>Takua sat up. "Jaller?" he said.</p>
			<p>Jaller looked at him, his eyes widening as he spotted the Rahkshi. The creatures hovered right past Kopaka, who appeared to be unconscious, heading straight for the two Matoran.</p>
			<p>"Why us?" Jaller said. "What did <i>we</i> do?"</p>
			<p>Takua spotted the Mask of Light in his friend's hand. "The mask!" he cried. He grabbed the mask, which started glowing brighter than ever. Pushing Kopaka's shield onto the cold water of the lake, he jumped on, using the mask as a paddle.</p>
			<p>Left behind, Jaller watched nervously as the Rahkshi approached. He dove out of the way as they hovered toward him. But they didn't even glance his way. Their glowing eyes were focused on Takua. They hovered out over the water, following him.</p>
			<p>Takua paddled as hard as he could. But with every glance back, he saw the Rahkshi gaining on him. Finally they were close enough to reach out for him with their clawed arms.</p>
			<p>Takua held the mask close to his chest as the creatures hissed threateningly, grabbing at him. <i>I guess this is it,</i> he thought hopelessly as a clawed hand snapped only a whisper away from his face.</p>
			<p>Just then his gaze caught motion back on the lakeshore. Kopaka was awake-he was swinging his ice blade overhead. A second later a blast of elemental ice spun through the air, heading straight for the Rahkshi!</p>
			<p>The icy blast hit the Fragmenter-Rahkshi and knocked it off balance. It crashed into the other two creatures, and all three of them toppled and landed in the lake with a splash.</p>
			<p>"Ha!" Takua cried excitedly, leaning over the edge of the shield to look at the spot where the Rahkshi had disappeared.</p>
			<p>A clawed hand shot up, only inches from his face.</p>
			<p>"Yaaaa!" Takua yelped, pulling his head back.</p>
			<p>Kopaka twirled his blade, then stabbed the point into the edge of the lake. The water crystallized instantly into ice, the deep freeze spreading rapidly until the entire lake was frozen solid. The Rahkshi, who were just reaching the surface, were trapped in place.</p>
			<p>Kopaka and Jaller walked out onto the ice. "Good moves," Kopaka said when they reached Takua.</p>
			<p>Takua shrugged. "Even I get lucky sometimes," he said, a little awed by the words of praise from the Toa.</p>
			<p>"Not luck," Kopaka corrected. "It is what you <i>do</i> that makes a hero."</p>
			<p>There was a sound from behind them. All three whirled around to look.</p>
			<p>"Pewku!" Takua cried in amazement as he saw the familiar form of the Ussal crab trotting across the ice.</p>
			<p>Pewku ran toward him. Her feet skidded on the slippery ice, and she wound up crashing into Takua, knocking him over.</p>
			<p>Takua laughed and hugged her. "Wow!" he said. "She must have come all the way through the jungle."</p>
			<p>"Not bad," Jaller said with a smile. "Maybe Pewku should be the Herald, eh, Toa Kopaka?"</p>
			<p>He turned to glance at the Toa. But the spot where Kopaka had been standing just a moment before was empty. The Toa was back on the shore, leaping up the sheer face of the icy cliff.</p>
			<p>Jaller blinked. "He just left us here!"</p>
			<p>Takua nodded, remembering the distressing view of Ko-Koro. "He needs to see his village." He held the Mask of Light toward his friend. "Here."</p>
			<p>Jaller started to reach for it, then hesitated. "You were looking pretty Herald-like back there. Sure you don't want to hang on to it?"</p>
			<p>Takua slapped the mask against Jaller's chest. "Tempting," he said as the mask's glow slowly faded. "But no."</p>
			<p>12. The Decision</p>
			<p>A few hours later, Takua, Jaller, and Pewku stopped beside a small tunnel entrance dug out of an icy mountainside. Takua leaned closer to read the writing on a battered old totem that marked the entrance.</p>
			<p>"Onu-Koro," he read. He glanced at Jaller. "It doesn't look like it's been used in a while. And we don't have a lightstone."</p>
			<p>Jaller held up the faintly glowing mask. "Who needs lightstones?"</p>
			<p>He led the way into the tunnel. Pewku followed. Takua hesitated, then climbed down into the darkness after them.</p>
			<p>The tunnels were too low to allow the Matoran to ride Pewku, so all three of them walked along on foot. Takua was lagging behind. He didn't want to admit it, but being underground made him nervous. It was too still. Too close. And much, much too dark.</p>
			<p><i>Takua...</i></p>
			<p>Takua stopped short. Was he hearing things? He peered into the darkness behind him. But there was no sign of life or movement.</p>
			<p>By the time he turned around, Jaller and Pewku had disappeared.</p>
			<p>"Uh, guys?" Takua called. "Where'd you go?"</p>
			<p><i>Takua...</i></p>
			<p>Takua gulped. That time he'd definitely heard it. But who? Where? Why?</p>
			<p>He wasn't sure he wanted to know the answer. "J-Jaller?" he called, racing forward. "JALLER! <i>Oof</i>-"</p>
			<p>In the blinding dark, he crashed into a wall and fell.</p>
			<p>Suddenly an eerie red glow lit up the tunnel. A pair of red eyes appeared in the dimness.</p>
			<p>"Shadows are everything," a voice hissed. "And where they are, so am I."</p>
			<p>Takua backed away from the eyes. His heart was pounding. The Makuta. It had to be. "I know who you are," he said, trying to keep his voice from quavering. "I-I'm not afraid."</p>
			<p>"Even my shadows cannot hide your fear," Makuta said. "Or the truth."</p>
			<p>"What truth?" Takua asked.</p>
			<p>"That you will not find the Seventh Toa. And deep down, you know it."</p>
			<p>"So I won't," Takua said uncertainly. "Maybe Jaller will."</p>
			<p>"And if he doesn't?" Makuta's voice was more ominous than ever. "He will die, because of you. Bring <i>me</i> the mask, Takua. Bring it to me and you won't lose your friend."</p>
			<p>Takua was horrified. Was this his choice? Betray all of Mata Nui-or allow Jaller to die?</p>
			<p><i>Makuta is said to be the master of lies,</i> he thought. <i>Maybe this choice is a lie, too...</i></p>
			<p>"N-no!" he cried, trying to sound bold and sure. "I won't let everyone down."</p>
			<p>"You fail them more if you refuse," Makuta said. "For the mask, your villages <i>and</i> Jaller will be spared. Don't be a fool."</p>
			<p>"N-no," Takua stammered, confused. "I can't..."</p>
			<p>Suddenly a flash of light flooded the tunnel. "Hey!" Jaller's voice called from somewhere ahead. A second later he and Pewku appeared. "Keep up, kolhii-head," Jaller chided. "I found some better tunnels!"</p>
			<p>Takua stared around wildly. But there was no sign of Makuta. Unable to speak, he merely nodded and followed as Jaller and Pewku turned and headed down the tunnel again.</p>
			<p>"So where'd you wander off to?" Jaller asked over his shoulder as they walked.</p>
			<p>"Jaller," Takua said. "Um, about the mask..."</p>
			<p>"What about it?" Jaller asked. "You ready to take it? <i>Finally</i>?"</p>
			<p>Takua paused, struggling to make up his mind. "I can't..." He took a deep breath. "...go with you."</p>
			<p>"What?" Jaller exclaimed, clutching the mask, which faded slightly. "Why?"</p>
			<p>Takua could only shake his head hopelessly. "I...can't explain," he croaked.</p>
			<p>Jaller frowned. "Oh, that's just great," he said angrily. "First you stick me with <i>your</i> duty and then you ditch me?"</p>
			<p>Takua couldn't meet his friend's eyes. "My duty is to myself," he muttered, turning away. "I quit. Just take the mask and go."</p>
			<p>At that moment, the last of the mask's light faded. "Fine," Jaller said. At his words, the mask's glow returned-at least a little. "But <i>I</i> won't give up. I will find the Seventh Toa, whether you're the true Herald or not."</p>
			<p>Pewku stood still, staring first after Takua and then Jaller. She turned and followed Takua.</p>
			<p>Makuta watched Takua's retreat from his lair deep beneath the tunnels, his red eyes glowing with anger. "My fairness spurned..." he hissed, turning toward the giant mask of Mata Nui on the wall. "My gentle sons bound in ice." He glared at the mask. "So, my hand is cast."</p>
			<p>He turned to face three stone pillars, nearly identical to the ones from which the Rahkshi had emerged. As Makuta walked by them, three shadowy forms burst out of them.</p>
			<p>"Now, I must pierce that which the Toa hold dear," Makuta said. He stopped in front of one of the new figures-another Rahkshi, this one white in color. Its name was Kurahk-the Anger-Rahkshi. "Anger among them will threaten their precious unity."</p>
			<p>Makuta walked on. This time he paused before a Rahkshi that was as black as night. Vorahk-the Hunger-Rahkshi.</p>
			<p>"Hunger will consume their duty," Makuta said as the creature's staff quivered with energy.</p>
			<p>The third Rahkshi was colored in fearful shades of red. This was Turahk, the Fear-Rahkshi.</p>
			<p>"And fear will keep them from their destiny." Makuta turned away from the three new Rahkshi, once again facing the still mask of Mata Nui. "They will not disturb your sleep."</p>
			<h2>13. Battle</h2>
			<p>Onua and Pohatu were conferring in the center courtyard of Onu-Koro when they heard steps approaching from one of the tunnels.</p>
			<p>Pohatu saw an exhausted-looking Ussal crab trotting toward him. His eyes widened in surprise as he recognized the figure riding atop the Ussal's back.</p>
			<p>"Chronicler!" Pohatu exclaimed as Takua and Pewku made their way toward the Toa. "Where is the Herald?"</p>
			<p>Takua looked tired and uncertain. "Uh, we got...separated," he said. "After we met the Rahkshi."</p>
			<p>Onua and Pohatu exchanged a glance. "What is Rahkshi?" Pohatu asked Takua.</p>
			<p>Before Takua could answer, the ground shuddered. The villagers around them cried out in alarm. Suddenly the cavern wall burst open-and three tall, horrifying figures leaped into view, hissing angrily.</p>
			<p>"Those!" Takua cried, pointing to the Rahkshi. He blinked, realizing that the colors were different. "Except...different ones."</p>
			<p>"Clear the cave!" Onua shouted. "And close the tunnel behind you!"</p>
			<p>The Onu-Matoran scattered, racing for the tunnels leading away from the cavern. Meanwhile Onua and Pohatu faced the three Rahkshi.</p>
			<p>"Let me show you a real Onu-Koro welcome," Onua rumbled. He slammed his fists into the ground, creating an elemental tidal wave of earth and stone. The wave rippled toward the Rahkshi and swallowed them.</p>
			<p>But when the wave had passed, the Rahkshi rose up again, unharmed.</p>
			<p>Onua grunted in surprise. The Hunger-Rahkshi leaped toward him, wielding its staff. Onua grabbed at the staff, trying to pull it away.</p>
			<p>Meanwhile Pohatu raced toward the Fear-Rahkshi. The creature raised its staff, sending dark energy waves rippling out from it. As soon as Pohatu hit the circle of energy, he stopped in midstride, his eyes filled with dark fear.</p>
			<p>"No..." he whimpered, mesmerized by the overwhelming, inescapable fear. All of his worst fears seemed to be exploding within him. "Water, sinking, drowning...!"</p>
			<p>The Hunger-Rahkshi hissed at Onua as they struggled over the staff. The creature activated the staff. Dark hunger energy flooded into Onua, instantly draining him of power, channeling it instead back into the Rahkshi's staff.</p>
			<p>"My strength," Onua whispered weakly. "My power..."</p>
			<p>His eyes dimmed and he fell over backward, landing with a mighty crash. He couldn't move-his energy was completely gone, replaced by a gnawing, devastating hunger.</p>
			<p>"Onua!" Pohatu cried.</p>
			<p>Still imprisoned by a wall of fear, Pohatu was unable to help. And the more he struggled against it, the more the terror overwhelmed him-until, with a final moan of helplessness, he collapsed to the ground.</p>
			<p>Takua tried to avoid the fleeing villagers as he and Pewku searched for escape as well. The three Rahkshi turned and spotted him in the crowds. Knocking other Matoran out of the way, they stalked after him with a hiss.</p>
			<p>Pewku found her way to a tunnel while the Rahkshi were still halfway back across the large cavern. Takua breathed out in relief. They were going to make it!</p>
			<p>Then he turned and saw the scene behind him. The Rahkshi were stomping on huts and shoving aside terrified Onu-Matoran. Onua and Pohatu were still sprawled motionless on the cavern floor.</p>
			<p><i>This is my fault,</i> Takua realized. <i>They're destroying everything in their path-to get to </i>me.</p>
			<p>His eyes hardened with resolve. Grabbing a kolhii stick that was leaning against a hut nearby, he turned Pewku to face the approaching Rahkshi.</p>
			<p>"Yah, Pewku!" he shouted, urging the Ussal onward. "Yah!"</p>
			<p>Pewku tried to do as he said. But so many villagers were fleeing, flowing around them in their race for the tunnel, that they could hardly move forward. Finally Takua gave up. Slumping to the ground, he closed his eyes and waited for the Rahkshi to reach him.</p>
			<p>Pewku whined frantically, trying to get him to move. But he pushed her claw aside.</p>
			<p>"Go find a real hero," he mumbled miserably. "What can I do?"</p>
			<p>Tahu, Lewa, and Gali raced through a tunnel, heading toward the main cavern of Onu-Koro. They skidded to a stop as they reached the end of the tunnel and saw the mayhem in the cavern.</p>
			<p>Tahu's eyes flashed with anger as he took it in. The poison taint, which had spread to cover half of his face, glowed angrily as well.</p>
			<p>He leaped into the cavern without a word. "Tahu!" Lewa cried, grabbing at him. But it was too late.</p>
			<p>"RAHKSHI!" Tahu bellowed furiously, racing toward the creatures. He charged at the Anger-Rahkshi first.</p>
			<p>The Anger-Rahkshi banged its staff on the ground. A ring of dark energy rippled across the cavern floor, hitting Tahu and knocking him off of his feet.</p>
			<p>The Fire Toa landed with a grunt on the hard ground. Gali and Lewa leaped out of the tunnel and raced toward the action. Lewa spotted a small figure huddled on the ground near the Rahkshi.</p>
			<p><i>The Chronicler,</i> he thought in surprise. <i>And his crab friend, Pewku. Looks like they're in badneed of a rescue.</i></p>
			<p>He glided toward them, grabbing Takua in one arm and Pewku in the other.</p>
			<p>The Rahkshi hissed in frustration as they saw their quarry fly away across the cavern. They turned and stalked after him.</p>
			<p>Tahu's eyes glowed dark, anger-energy flashing across them. The poison taint had spread once again and now covered his entire mask.</p>
			<p>He leaped to his feet. Gali gasped as she saw that it wasn't just Tahu's mask that was poisoned now. The taint had spread across his entire body!</p>
			<p><i>The Rahkshi's anger-energy must have caused it to spread more rapidly,</i> she thought in alarm.</p>
			<p>She took a step toward him. "Brother!" she said with concern.</p>
			<p>"FIRE HAS NO BROTHERS!" Tahu howled. "FIRE CONSUMES ALL!"</p>
			<p>He slammed his swords into the ground. Jagged fissures of lava burst into life and tore across the ground in all directions. Gali balanced on a pillar of earth as fire consumed the ground on either side.</p>
			<p>Tahu looked at her, but there was no recognition in his eyes-only anger. He slammed his swords down again, sending another fissure of lava right at Gali. She somersaulted away just in time as the ground exploded into flame.</p>
			<p>Across the cavern, Lewa glided down and deposited Takua and Pewku beside Onua and Pohatu. "No thought-thinking," the Toa ordered Takua breathlessly. "Quickspeed to Jaller. Warn him!"</p>
			<p>"I...er...will," Takua called as the Air Toa glided away, heading toward Tahu and Gali.</p>
			<p>Takua led the way as he and Pewku raced toward an escape tunnel. But a few strides away, the Ussal veered suddenly, heading down a narrow foundry doorway instead.</p>
			<p>"Pewku!" Takua cried. "Where are you going?"</p>
			<p>He followed her. A moment later, the Rahkshi disappeared through the foundry door as well. At that moment back in the cavern, Pohatu finally came to and sat up. He glanced at Onua, who was pushing himself upright nearby. "Rise and shine, brother," Pohatu joked weakly.</p>
			<p>Onua merely groaned in response.</p>
			<p>The heat rolled over Takua in waves as he followed Pewku into the depths of the foundry. Several fires blazed beneath narrow exhaust chimneys cut into the rock ceiling. Mine-cars loaded with lightstones sat on their tracks, waiting to move out.</p>
			<p><i>Dead end,</i> Takua realized as he stared around the chamber. <i>There's no way out except the way we came...and we can't go that way.</i></p>
			<p>The trio of Rahkshi emerged from the entry tunnel into the foundry chamber with a loud hiss. Pewku raced toward one of the chimneys. She grunted urgently at Takua and leaped up, scrambling for a hold on the rough rock sides.</p>
			<p>Takua took a deep breath. What choice did he have? He leaped up, following the Ussal into the soot-blackened chimney.</p>
			<p>As he struggled to climb up the chimney, he heard the Rahkshi hissing directly beneath him. He tried to climb faster, but it was no use-the Fear-Rahkshi was right behind him. It lunged up, grabbing for his foot.</p>
			<h2>14. Buried Alive</h2>
			<p>Suddenly a claw spun into view, pinning the Fear-Rahkshi's arm to the wall just before its clawed hand closed around Takua's leg. It was one of Toa Pohatu's mighty climbing claws!</p>
			<p>The other two Rahkshi charged toward the Toa. Onua slammed his fists outward into the cavern walls. The section of ceiling directly over the Rahkshi collapsed, piling rocks and stone dust over them.</p>
			<p>Breathing a sigh of relief, Takua pulled himself up to safety.</p>
			<p>In the courtyard cavern, Tahu swiped his swords at Lewa, who dodged them easily. Tahu lunged at Lewa again.</p>
			<p>Rocks rained down on him from the ceiling, mixed with snow. Suddenly a stream of water struck Tahu from behind.</p>
			<p>Howling with anger, he turned to find Gali behind him.</p>
			<p>"Tahu," she called. "Remember who you are! Remember your destiny." She unleashed another stream of water. Tahu's armor steamed as the cool water hit it.</p>
			<p>"I HAVE NO DESTINY!" he roared furiously. "I-agh?"</p>
			<p>He jumped in surprise as a shape plummeted to the ground behind him. Kopaka! The Ice Toa touched his blade to the ground. A layer of frost washed over the ground, trapping Tahu in a thick coating of ice.</p>
			<p>Lewa stepped forward. He and Kopaka each took one of the frozen Tahu's arms, carrying him toward an exit tunnel.</p>
			<p>Gali looked around for the others as she raced after them. She saw Onua's quake-breakers smash through the stone of a collapsed foundry entrance and breathed out with relief as he and Pohatu emerged into the courtyard chamber.</p>
			<p>Lewa and Kopaka carried the unconscious Tahu into a tunnel. Gali followed. Once inside the tunnel, she turned back to check on the others' progress. Pohatu and Onua raced across the chamber toward her. They were steps away from safety when there was an ominous rumble. A split second later, the entire cavern collapsed on top of them.</p>
			<p>Gali gasped in horror. "Our brothers!" she cried as rocks and earth rained down, burying everything in a deep layer of debris.</p>
			<p>She tried to leap out, to go help. But Kopaka stopped her.</p>
			<p>He gave her a somber look. Gali returned the look for a long moment, then glanced out at the caved-in courtyard area. There was no sound, no movement except the settling dust.</p>
			<p>She bowed her head sadly and returned to follow the others.</p>
			<p>With a grunt and a clatter, Pewku pulled herself up and out of the top of the chimney. She fell to the snowy ground outside with a sigh of relief.</p>
			<p>A moment later, Takua clambered out after her. He flopped to the ground, exhausted. He wished he could just lie there, sleeping in the soft snow. But he knew that he couldn't do that.</p>
			<p>Pewku grunted questioningly as Takua climbed to his feet. "No time to rest," he told her. "We've got to find Jaller. Come on!"</p>
			<p>A short distance away, on the shores of a frozen glacial lake, the setting sun's rays touched the end of a staff protruding out of the ice. As the last light faded and dusk fell, the staff and everything else fell into dark shadow.</p>
			<p>For a long moment, nothing moved. Then a flicker of dark energy burst out of the end of the staff. The ice around it splintered and began to crack and melt.</p>
			<h2>15. Together Again</h2>
			<p>As the sun rose above the horizon, Jaller tried to keep his gaze on his goal-the craggy top section of the Mangai volcano. He struggled up a rocky slope, clutching the Mask of Light.</p>
			<p>As he crested the slope, he groaned in dismay. Another steep cliff side still lay between him and the top of the volcano!</p>
			<p>His legs ached, and his eyes strained in the bright morning sunlight. Would he be able to make it? And even if he reached the top of the volcano, what then? Would he find the Seventh Toa there-or would the mask lead him off in yet another direction?</p>
			<p>"Mata Nui," he cried. "Show me where my destiny lies!"</p>
			<p>Suddenly the ground quaked beneath him. Jaller was thrown off his feet-and off of the ledge. He barely managed to grab onto it and avoid falling.</p>
			<p>He sighed and glanced upward, rolling his eyes. "Well," he said to the sky, "I guess I asked!"</p>
			<p>The ground shook again. But this time, Jaller realized it was the rumble of galloping footsteps coming toward him.</p>
			<p>"What now?" he wondered aloud.</p>
			<p>Jaller's eyes widened as Pewku galloped onto the ledge. Takua was riding on her broad back, holding a kolhii stick in one hand.</p>
			<p>Takua leaned over Pewku's side, stretching the kolhii stick down toward Jaller. Jaller grabbed it, holding on tightly as his friend pulled him to safety.</p>
			<p>Soon Jaller was seated behind Takua on Pewku's back. "What happened to 'I quit'?" he asked breathlessly.</p>
			<p>Takua grinned. "I tried that," he said. "But no one will let me." His face grew serious. "Bad news. More Rahkshi. They've taken Onu-Koro."</p>
			<p>"The Mask of Light was never at Onu-Koro," Jaller said, confused.</p>
			<p>Takua shrugged. "They don't want the mask," he said. "They're looking for the Herald."</p>
			<p>Jaller still looked puzzled. "You're sure they were after the Herald?"</p>
			<p>Takua glanced at him over his shoulder. "Oh, yes," he said. "<i>Very</i> sure."</p>
			<p>Tahu roared, struggling to free himself from the vines that trapped him. He crashed from side to side, the large, flat stone beneath him glowing hot with the force of his fury.</p>
			<p>"The poison is destroying him," Gali said quietly, watching from nearby.</p>
			<p>Lewa and Kopaka stood beside her near a tunnel entrance in the jungle.</p>
			<p>"We must act," Gali continued. "Let us summon all the healing powers we possess."</p>
			<p>The three of them gathered around Tahu. The Fire Toa hardly seemed aware of their presence as he growled and fought against his restraints.</p>
			<p>Lewa raised Tahu's magma swords. They burned weakly, with nothing more than a sputtering flicker.</p>
			<p>"His flame is but an emberglow!" Lewa noted in alarm.</p>
			<p>"Kopaka," Gali said.</p>
			<p>Kopaka produced his own blade. He crossed it with the magma swords in front of Tahu's face. The energy of two Toa's blades exploded in a blinding flash of light, then flowed down into Tahu's body.</p>
			<p>Tahu roared defiantly as the energy flooded him. He was soon enveloped in glowing white steam.</p>
			<p>"Enough!" Gali cried.</p>
			<p>Kopaka and Lewa pulled back the swords. The steam dissipated, revealing Tahu-and the poison taint still covering his body. The Fire Toa lay still, his eyes dark.</p>
			<p>"Brother!" Lewa cried, fearing the worst.</p>
			<p>Gali brought her hands together. Water droplets rushed together at her call, forming a liquid sphere that spun in front of her. <i>Liquid of life, do your magic,</i> she thought, focusing all of her energy on the water's cleansing power.</p>
			<p>She unleashed the water at Tahu in a gentle mist. A rainbow formed as the droplets danced over his still form.</p>
			<p>The water bathed him, washing away the poison along with the scratch on his mask. Within seconds, healthy red armor shone out.</p>
			<p>Gali slumped, exhausted. Kopaka caught her, carefully helping her move away to rest.</p>
			<p>Lewa gazed down at Tahu. The Fire Toa still lay motionless, but Lewa could see that Gali's efforts had worked. There was no sign of the poison taint.</p>
			<p>Lewa very gently clanked his fist against Tahu's hand. "I'm right here, Toa brother," he murmured.</p>
			<p>Gali was kneeling beside a jungle pond. She held her hands beneath the water, taking energy from it. Kopaka stood behind her, watching.</p>
			<p>"Kopaka," Gali said with a sigh as she felt herself recharged. "Do you think the Turaga were right about us? Have we lost our unity?" She paused, gazing down at the still water. When the Ice Toa didn't answer, she turned her head. "Kopaka?"</p>
			<p>But he was gone. Gali sighed.</p>
			<p>Just then Lewa called out for her. "Sister, he is openeyed!"</p>
			<p>Gali hurried back to the clearing. Tahu was sitting up, unwrapping the vines from his wrists.</p>
			<p>"Brother," Gali greeted him. "Are you well?"</p>
			<p>Tahu glared at her. "No, I am not well." Then his eyes softened. "But I am alive and in your debt...my sister."</p>
			<p>He tentatively lifted his fist toward her. Gali smiled and gently clanked it with her own.</p>
			<h2>16. Kini-Nui</h2>
			<p>Jaller breathed out, awed by the sight that lay before his eyes. "Kini-Nui!" he whispered. "The Great Temple!"</p>
			<p>The temple and the surrounding mountains were bathed in the colorful rays of the setting sun. The Mask of Light glowed as they crossed the Amaja Circle. As they approached a giant head carved into the stone at the edge of the plateau, the mask's light faded.</p>
			<p>"No way," Takua said. "We've been all over the island, just to wind up here?"</p>
			<p>"Why not? It's a sacred place," Jaller pointed out.</p>
			<p>Takua grabbed the mask, which immediately glowed brightly again. "You sure you're working this right?"</p>
			<p>At that moment a beam of brilliant light shot out of the mask. It landed on the giant stone head. The ground quaked, shaking loose countless years' worth of dirt and grime from the carving. As the outlines of a mask began to be visible underneath, the sun dipped beneath the horizon, plunging the temple into dusky dimness.</p>
			<p>"Wow, this is it," Jaller said. "The Seventh Toa must be here."</p>
			<p>An ominous hiss rose nearby. Takua and Jaller turned toward the sound in fear. Three Rahkshi stepped out from behind a rock-Fragmenter, Disintegrator, and Poison.</p>
			<p>Jaller gasped. "Give me the mask, Takua," he said grimly, grabbing it from his friend's hands.</p>
			<p>"Jaller, no!" Takua cried. "We both know the mask chose me. I am the true Herald."</p>
			<p>"Are you still sure, even now?"</p>
			<p>Takua held out his hand. "Yes!" he said firmly. "I'm the Herald."</p>
			<p>Jaller hesitated briefly, then handed over the mask. Takua nodded. "And I say...<i>run</i>!" he cried.</p>
			<p>Takua, Jaller, and Pewku raced down toward the lower plateau. The ground quaked again at the base of the steps. A fissure erupted in a shower of rocks and earth, and three more Rahkshi burst out of the ground!</p>
			<p>Takua and Jaller turned to race back up the steps. But the first trio of Rahkshi were already descending from the top. They were trapped!</p>
			<p>Suddenly a flare of brilliant fire rocketed overhead, illuminating the entire temple.</p>
			<p>The Rahkshi shielded their faces against the glare. An urn atop the enormous stone head ignited, illuminating Lewa and Gali, who stood on either side. Tahu stepped in from the shadows, the fire reflecting off of his bright red armor.</p>
			<p>Takua let out a breath of relief. "Great!" he called to the three Toa as they leaped into the air. "You can get us out of here!"</p>
			<p>Tahu pulled out his swords. "We are done running."</p>
			<p>The Fragmenter-Rahkshi hissed, unleashing an arc of energy from its staff. Tahu lifted his shield, enveloping all of the Toa and Matoran in a protective force field. He staggered backward as the Rahkshi's bolt hit, but recovered quickly.</p>
			<p>"We will not be broken!" the Fire Toa shouted defiantly.</p>
			<p>He and Lewa stood side by side as the Fragmenter-, Poison-, and Disintegrator-Rahkshi approached. Behind them, Gali led Takua and Jaller down the steps toward the lower temple.</p>
			<p>"This way!" she cried.</p>
			<p>Lewa summoned a whirlwind, sending it spinning down to grab the sand from the Amaja Circle. The sand cycloned feverishly, enveloping the advancing Rahkshi. Tahu crossed his swords, sending a blast of fire into the swirling sandstorm. The sand particles glowed red, then white-hot. When Tahu and Lewa both lowered their arms, their creation remained-the Rahkshi were trapped from the neck down in a prison of glass!</p>
			<p>In the lower temple, the other three Rahkshi moved toward Gali and her charges, cutting off their escape. The ground between them suddenly rumbled and exploded. Three figures erupted out of the quake, landing beside Gali and the others.</p>
			<p>Gali cried out in amazement as she recognized the Ice, Earth, and Stone Toa. "Brothers!" she shouted to Pohatu and Onua. "We thought we lost you."</p>
			<p>"You might have, but for our frosty friend," Onua replied, gesturing toward Kopaka.</p>
			<p>Kopaka shrugged. "It was...on the way."</p>
			<p>Gali raised an eyebrow. "Kopaka had to dig out the chief miner?"</p>
			<p>Onua looked sheepish. "Well, he needs to get his hands dirty from time to time."</p>
			<p>The Hunger-, Anger-, and Fear-Rahkshi had recovered from the surprise of the Toa's arrival. They advanced again, hissing menacingly.</p>
			<p>The Anger-Rahkshi banged its staff on the ground, sending a ring of dark anger energy toward the Toa. But the energy passed right through them, leaving them untouched. The Rahkshi hissed in surprise.</p>
			<p>"Our anger is no more, Rahkshi," Tahu said. "We are united!"</p>
			<p>Lewa and Pohatu leaped into action, somersaulting around the three Rahkshi faster than the eye could follow. The creatures swung their staffs wildly at their tumbling foes-but wound up striking one another instead!</p>
			<p>The Fear-Rahkshi sqealed in dismay as the Hunger-Rahkshi's staff hit it. Its fear energy drained from its body, sending it tumbling helplessly to the ground.</p>
			<p>The Hunger-Rahkshi hissed. Turning away from the circling Toa, it leaped toward Takua and Jaller. In the blink of an eye, Tahu and Gali joined together and summoned their elemental powers. A blast of steam burst from their tools, catching the Hunger-Rahkshi in its mighty stream and lifting it into the air.</p>
			<p>The Toa moved in on the Anger-Rahkshi. The creature backed away, hissing in frustration.</p>
			<p>Behind the Toa, the Fear-Rahkshi stirred. Its eyes began to glow as energy flowed back into its body. The creature climbed to its feet and started up the steps toward Takua and Jaller.</p>
			<p>The Toa didn't notice. All of their attention was focused on the Anger-Rahkshi in front of them. "Now," Tahu shouted. "As one!"</p>
			<p>The others knew what to do.</p>
			<p>Onua slammed the ground, sending a wave of earth toward the Anger-Rahkshi.</p>
			<p>Pohatu transformed the rolling wave of earth into a wave of boulders.</p>
			<p>Tahu transformed the boulders into a wave of lava, which broke over the Rahkshi, enveloping it.</p>
			<p>The Anger-Rahkshi tried to escape the lava. But suddenly the jet of steam dissipated, sending the Hunger-Rahkshi plunging back to earth-right on top of the Anger-Rahkshi!</p>
			<p>Kopaka jumped forward, striking the lava with his sword and instantly freezing it solid. Both the Hunger- and Anger-Rahkshi were frozen along with it.</p>
			<p>Tahu stepped toward them, examining the Toa's handiwork. "They've been trapped before and were still able to escape," he reminded the others.</p>
			<p>Kopaka leaned in, yanking the kraata out of the Rahkshi's armored bodies. "Not this time."</p>
			<p>A frightened squeal erupted from somewhere above. Glancing up, the Toa were just in time to see Pewku tumble down the steps, tossed aside by the Fear-Rahkshi. The creature turned with a hiss, backing Takua and Jaller up the steps.</p>
			<h2>17. One Destiny</h2>
			<p>"Hang on!" Gali shouted.</p>
			<p>Takua looked down, trying to see the Toa. Instead, his gaze caught the beam of dark fear energy emanating from the Rahkshi's staff. He fell to his knees, instantly transfixed.</p>
			<p>The Fear-Rahkshi rose up on its long legs, towering over Takua. It swung its staff toward the helpless Matoran.</p>
			<p>But Jaller had seen what was happening. He leaped forward, swinging the kolhii stick he was holding.</p>
			<p>Takua snapped out of his fear trance as Jaller intercepted the Rahkshi's blow. "<i>Jaller!</i>" he screamed as dark energy sizzled through his friend's body.</p>
			<p>The Fear-Rahkshi turned toward him, its eyes glittering wickedly. But before it could strike again, Gali and Pohatu leaped in and grabbed it by the arms.</p>
			<p>Takua dropped the mask, racing over and cradling his fallen friend. "What have you done?" he cried as Jaller's eyes dimmed. "I'm supposed to make the sacrifice! I'm the Herald!"</p>
			<p>"No," Jaller said weakly. "The duty was mine. You know..." He paused, gathering the last scraps of his fading strength. He took in a ragged breath.</p>
			<p>"...who you are," he whispered faintly. Stretching out his hand, he picked up the Mask of Light and put it in Takua's hands. "You were always different."</p>
			<p>Jaller's hand dropped limply onto the stone. Gently lowering his friend's head to the ground, Takua stood, lifting the mask. It glowed more brightly than ever.</p>
			<p>Takua stood still for a moment, his eyes distant.</p>
			<p>Nearby, the Fear-Rahkshi struggled free of Gali's and Pohatu's grip. The two Toa lost their footing and stumbled down the steps, crashing into the other Toa, who were on their way to help.</p>
			<p>Takua turned the mask over in his hands again. His eyes narrowed purposefully. As he lifted it to his face, the mask's glow brightened again. As it made contact with his own mask, it burst forth with brilliant beams of white light.</p>
			<p><i>He</i> was the Seventh Toa!</p>
			<p>He could feel his body transforming as the mask's power flooded through him. He became taller, stronger, brighter. Light emanated from him, freezing the Fear-Rahkshi in its tracks.</p>
			<p>The other six Toa gazed up at him in awe. They fell to their knees.</p>
			<p>"Hail, brother Toa!" they said in one voice.</p>
			<p>Takua stared at his own hand, which glowed white-hot with light energy. He picked up Jaller's kolhii stick, and a small spark jumped from his hand to the stick, transforming it into the Kolhii Staff of Light.</p>
			<p>He turned to face the other Toa, his eyes filled with awe and power. "I am Takanuva," he declared. "Toa of Light!"</p>
			<p>As the white light bursting from him illuminated the entire temple, he bent and picked up Jaller's body. He carried it down the steps past the other Toa. Each of them raised his or her weapon in salute, then followed the Toa of Light with their heads solemnly bowed.</p>
			<p>The next morning, Takanuva stood gazing down at the suva-style grave dome that had been raised in a quiet spot overlooking the Kini-Nui temple. A memorial pillar rose from the top of the dome, and Jaller's mask rested upon it.</p>
			<p>Turaga Vakama stepped toward the Toa of Light. "You have finally found your own story," he said quietly, "and still you seek answers."</p>
			<p>Takanuva stared at Jaller's mask. "All this, just to discover who I am?"</p>
			<p>Vakama shrugged. "Mata Nui is wiser than all," he replied. "The path you walked was not to be here..." He paused and gestured at the temple. "But <i>here</i>." He tapped Takanuva on the chest. "You understand you have but one destiny."</p>
			<p>Lewa helped Tahu attach a pipe to the vehicle they were building. "How will this wayfind the Makuta?" he asked.</p>
			<p>Takanuva stepped forward, holding the six kraata in his fist. "What is the Makuta's shall return to him." He inserted the kraata into the slot they'd created for that purpose. They writhed angrily in their restraints.</p>
			<p>Tahu looked up at the vehicle, which they were calling an Ussanui. They had created it out of parts of the defeated Rahkshi. Would it work?</p>
			<p>Before long, all seven Toa were gathered around the completed Ussanui vehicle. Hahli walked up to them, carefully carrying Jaller's mask.</p>
			<p>"Jaller was your Herald," she told Takanuva solemnly. "Let him continue to lead you to victory."</p>
			<p>She stepped to the front of the vehicle, attaching the mask to it. Takanuva nodded.</p>
			<p>"Well said, Hahli," he told her.</p>
			<p>Pohatu cocked his head at the vehicle curiously. "Not much room in this transport," he said. "Where will we sit, brother?"</p>
			<p>Takanuva shook his head. "You won't," he replied. "You shall not join me."</p>
			<p>The other Toa reacted with surprise. "But united, our power defeated the Rahkshi!" Pohatu reminded him.</p>
			<p>Tahu nodded. "Certainly it will take nothing less to defeat Makuta!"</p>
			<p>Takanuva turned away from them, staring at the transport. "I have but one destiny," he said. "Yours lie with the Matoran and the Turaga. Gather them and wait for my return."</p>
			<p>He stepped forward, climbing into the Ussanui vehicle. At last, he turned to look at the Toa gathered below.</p>
			<p>"Farewell," he told them.</p>
			<p>The Ussanui rocketed through the tunnels beneath the Kini-Nui. Takanuva held on grimly, not thinking or moving. Just waiting.</p>
			<p>Finally the Ussanui rounded another corner. An immense door blocked the tunnel, but the vehicle never slowed. It crashed straight into the door, cracking it open before bouncing off, skidding to a halt at last.</p>
			<p>Takanuva opened his eyes. As he climbed out of the wrecked vehicle, there was a rattling sound behind him.</p>
			<p>His eyes widened in amazement as a piece of the damaged vehicle was tossed aside and a familiar figure climbed out from the wreckage.</p>
			<p>"Hahli!" Takanuva cried.</p>
			<p>Hahli walked to the front of the vehicle and removed Jaller's mask. "Let <i>me</i> be your Chronicler," she told Takanuva with determination in her voice.</p>
			<p>Takanuva hesitated, then nodded. Reaching into the wreckage long enough to pull out the six kraata, he turned and stepped through the cracked door into the dark chamber beyond.</p>
			<h2>18. A Real Hero</h2>
			<p>Takanuva held the kraata tightly in his fist as he looked around the chamber. Behind him, Hahli started to step through the door, but he stopped her with a gesture. She backed off, watching through the crack.</p>
			<p>By the light emanating from his own mask Takanuva could see several massive, carved stone columns holding up the stone ceiling.</p>
			<p>Takanuva opened his hand. The kraata slithered free, writhing their way across the floor and around the pools, heading toward a dark doorway on the opposite end of the chamber. Two large red eyes opened in the darkness, staring toward the Toa.</p>
			<p>"You can no longer hide in shadow," Takanuva said, his eyes tightening in resolve.</p>
			<p>"I <i>am</i> shadow," Makuta's sinister voice rang out from the darkness. "The shadow that guards the gate. Now run along, or accept your doom."</p>
			<p>Takanuva stepped forward boldly. Suddenly he realized what he needed to do. "I am done running. Mata Nui will be awoken this day." He turned to Hahli, still peering through the doorway behind him. "Hahli, summon the Matoran."</p>
			<p>Hahli's face registered her shock at the request. But she nodded and hurried off.</p>
			<p>Takanuva waited calmly as Makuta started to move out of the shadows. "Toa of Light," the dark one hissed. "Now so bold. But at heart, you are still just Takua."</p>
			<p>He stepped into the light. The Mask of Shadow on his face glared down at Takanuva. Makuta was nearly twice the Toa's height.</p>
			<p>"Are you truly prepared to face me?"</p>
			<p>Though he tried to hide it, Takanuva was shocked at Makuta's size. But he held his ground as Makuta approached him.</p>
			<p>"You failed to save your friend," Makuta said. "You didn't even warn him. Perhaps for your next great failure..." He paused, holding out his arm. A Kolhii Staff of Shadow grew out of it. Then he motioned toward the doorway behind him. "A simple game of kolhii? Win and you may try to open the gate. When you lose, I'll have that mask."</p>
			<p>"I will not lose!" Takanuva retorted, clutching his own staff tightly.</p>
			<p>Makuta nodded, accepting the challenge. The surface of the nearest mercury pool rippled. A silvery ball slowly rose out of it, hovering in midair between Makuta and Takanuva.</p>
			<p>Both players leaped toward the ball. Takanuva was faster and reached it first, snatching it in the scoop on one end of his kolhii staff. Dodging Makuta's swiping blow, he darted past him.</p>
			<p>He landed on a perch along one of the pillars. Makuta followed, perching on another pillar. The ball fo mercury in Takanuva's scoop transformed suddenly into a glowing ball of light. Takanuva launched it toward Makuta.</p>
			<p>Makuta dodged the ball of light, which exploded against the pillar behind him.</p>
			<p>Another ball of mercury rose out of the pool. This time Makuta was the faster one. He grabbed the ball with his kolhii staff, and it immediately transformed into a ball of dark shadow energy. He flung it at Takanuva.</p>
			<p>The Toa leaped to the side. The ball of shadow crashed against another pillar, splintering it.</p>
			<p>The kolhii match continued. Neither player spoke; neither hesitated. And neither managed to score a hit on the other. Every time a ball crashed out of the game, another rose from the mercury to take its place.</p>
			<p>Finally Makuta launched a ball of darkness that flew toward Takanuva faster than ever. The Toa dodged it just in time, but the ball smashed into the pillar behind him with full force. The impact was too much for the structure-it splintered and came loose from the ceiling, plummeting into a hole that suddenly yawned open in the floor below it.</p>
			<p>Takanuva managed to leap to safety, rolling to a stop inches from a pool of mercury. Makuta jumped down and swooped on the next ball of mercury before the Toa could react. Then he stalked toward Takanuva.</p>
			<p>He laughed with dark triumph. "You know I cannot be beaten!"</p>
			<p>With that, he launched the ball of shadow straight at Takanuva.</p>
			<p>Hahli ran through the tunnels as fast as she could, still clutching Jaller's mask. The thought of her fallen friend gave strength to her legs and courage to her heart. Ahead of her, finally she saw a pinprick of daylight.</p>
			<p>A moment later she burst out of the crater of the ruined suva dome into the main temple area at Kini-Nui. The six Turaga and the six Toa stood around the dome crater, waiting. The entire population of the island was gathered behind them on the hillsides surrounding the temple, waiting to hear the fate of the Toa of Light.</p>
			<p>"I bring word from Takanuva!" Hahli blurted. She climbed out of the hole, breathing hard. "He wants us to follow. We are to awaken Mata Nui today!"</p>
			<p>The crowd, hearing the news, murmured uncertainly.</p>
			<p>"A light among the shadows," Turaga Vakama said in a faraway voice. "The prophecy is fulfilled. We must go!"</p>
			<p>Turaga Onewa's face was grim. "If we descend into those tunnels, we will never again return!"</p>
			<p>The crowd's murmurs grew louder. The villagers looked by turns nervous, excited, and uncertain.</p>
			<p>Hahli climbed up onto a chunk of stone and held up Jaller's mask. "This island is a great and wondrous place," she declared. "Never has any people been as blessed as we are to live in such a paradise."</p>
			<p>All around her, Turaga and Matoran nodded in agreement. Taking strength from her own convictions-and her memories of Jaller-Hahli continued.</p>
			<p>"I love my home," she said. "And Jaller loved it, too. But above all Jaller respected his duty. Let us repay him by doing <i>our</i> duty. Let us remember him by fulfilling our destiny! Let us go forward together." She glanced around at the crowd, which was hanging on her every word. "Let us awaken the Great Spirit!"</p>
			<p>The crowd burst into loud cheers. Hahli sighed with relief. She had done her duty. Now it was time for the island's people to do theirs.</p>
			<p>Takanuva barely managed to escape the ball of shadow. The effort of dodging it sent him flying off a pillar into space. He adjusted in midair, swinging his feet around until he was running straight down the pillar. The momentum carried him over to the mercury pool just as another ball rose from it.</p>
			<p>He grabbed it in his kolhii net. As soon as it transformed into a ball of light, he turned and hurled it toward Makuta.</p>
			<p>But the dark one was ready. He swung his own kolhii stick, catching the ball of light in his net and transforming it into darkness.</p>
			<p>Takanuva gasped in shock. Then he leaped to the side as the ball came hurtling back toward him, shattering another pillar and sending it collapsing onto the floor. Once again, the Toa of Light barely dodged in time, jumping over to another pillar-one of only two left standing in the cavern. He was growing tired. How much longer could he continue this game?</p>
			<p>Makuta grabbed the next mercury ball and transformed it. Then he walked toward the two pillars, searching for his quarry.</p>
			<p>"An audience gathers for your final failure, Toa of Light," Makuta said.</p>
			<p>Takanuva leaped high up the pillar, staying just out of his opponent's sight. "Maybe they will not see me win today," he said. "But the Matoran will go on, and someday <i>they</i> will triumph."</p>
			<p>"You actually believe I would let them return?" Makuta said. "After all the trouble they have been?"</p>
			<p>Just outside the cavern, Hahli rode Pewku toward the door, leading the six Toa, the six Turaga, and the Matoran crowd behind her. The Toa gathered around the crack in the doorway, looking through into Makuta's cavern.</p>
			<p>There was only one pillar left standing now. Takanuva clung to it, while Makuta stood at the base, a ball of darkness quivering in his net. The dark one turned, glancing toward the doorway.</p>
			<p>"Now that I have them," he said with malicious satisfaction, "they will not leave."</p>
			<p>With a sudden horror, Takanuva realized the truth-he had led his people into a trap!</p>
			<p>"NO!" he cried.</p>
			<p>Makuta launched the ball of darkness toward the voice overhead. Takanuva ducked it. The ball struck the pillar, which started to collapse.</p>
			<p>Takanuva landed on the ground on one side of the mercury pool. Makuta stood on the other. Without hesitating, the Toa of Light flipped himself over the mercury toward his enemy.</p>
			<p>A ball of mercury rose out of the pool, and Takanuva grabbed it in midflip, transforming it into a ball of light. He immediately rolled into his special kolhii move, somersaulting and throwing the ball at the same time.</p>
			<p>This time it worked-the ball of light flew right into Makuta's chest!</p>
			<p>The force of the impact knocked Makuta backward across the chamber. He staggered, then dropped to his knees with a mighty crash. Light energy flashed through his body.</p>
			<p>Makuta roared in pain as the light energy weakened him. "Well played, Toa," he croaked.</p>
			<p>Takanuva stepped forward. He had done it! He had finally defeated his enemy!</p>
			<p>But Makuta wasn't quite finished yet. As the Toa approached, the dark one suddenly flung out his hand, shoving Takanuva backward with surprising force.</p>
			<p>Takanuva grunted, startled. He fell back hard, landing near the pool of mercury.</p>
			<p>Makuta climbed to his feet. "Now I will protect Mata Nui from you," he snarled, marching toward the Toa of Light.</p>
			<p>"Protect him?" Confused, Takanuva lowered his staff.</p>
			<p>"Sleep spares him pain!" Makuta said. "Awake, he suffers."</p>
			<p>He continued stalking toward Takanuva, who found himself backing closer and closer to the pool of mercury. The Toa of Light wasn't sure what to think of the dark one's words. How could he think that Mata Nui was better off remaining asleep? How could he think that was best for the island?</p>
			<p>"But he does not live," he protested, still perplexed.</p>
			<p>Makuta raised his kolhii staff. Utter determination danced in his red eyes. "My duty remains to the shadows."</p>
			<p>Suddenly Takanuva smiled. The light had dawned in his mind-he knew what he had to do.</p>
			<p>"Then let's take a closer look at those shadows," he said.</p>
			<p>He dropped his kolhii staff and leaped toward Makuta, landing on his chest so that the two of them were face-to-face. With one hand Takanuva grabbed the Mask of Shadow, yanking it off of Makuta's head. His other hand pulled his own mask free. Before Makuta could react, the Toa had switched the masks, shoving the Mask of Light onto the dark one's face and placing the Mask of Shadow over his own face.</p>
			<p>"NO!" Makuta howled.</p>
			<p>Makuta staggered in a circle, the mask pulsing on his face. Then he toppled backward into the mercury pool, pulling Takanuva along with him.</p>
			<p>The other six Toa rushed into the room, followed by the Turaga and the others. They all gathered around the pool. The still, silvery surface remained unbroken for a long, long moment. The Toa exchanged glances, not sure what to think.</p>
			<p>Suddenly arcs of dark and light energy shot out of the mercury and danced across the surface. The Matoran took a wary step back.</p>
			<p>Then a huge head rose from the steaming mercury. Makuta? No, it wasn't the dark one-at least not completely. It was the merged face of Takanuva and Makuta-half Mask of Light, half Mask of Shadow. An enormous merged figure continued to rise slowly out of the pool, half light and half shadow.</p>
			<p>Takutanuva.</p>
			<p>The light side of the mask spoke. "Light has revealed the will of Mata Nui," Takutanuva's voice said.</p>
			<p>"Our brother must be awakened," the Makuta side added.</p>
			<p>The Toa, Turaga, and Matoran glanced at one another. None of them knew what to do or think now.</p>
			<p>Takutanuva stepped out of the pool and walked toward the huge door set into the wall on the far side of the cavern. He crouched down, his fingers gouging the metal of the door as he tried to lift it. The door creaked and groaned, then slowly began to rise.</p>
			<p>As Takutanuva struggled under the weight of the giant door, the Toa and the others stepped forward uncertainly and walked through into the chamber beyond. Hahli was still carrying Jaller's mask as she stepped past the giant two-sided figure.</p>
			<p>"Hold, little one," Makuta's voice stopped her. "That mask needs life."</p>
			<p>The shadowy side of Takutanuva reached out a hand. A powerful pulse of dark and light energy shot out from his fingertip, blasting into Jaller's mask.</p>
			<p>Hahli stepped back as the mask took on a life of its own. As she watched in amazement, Jaller's body quickly regenerated from the mask-his head, his body, his legs bursting into existence out of nothing. A dim glow lit up the eyes behind the mask, and a moment later Jaller fell backward weakly.</p>
			<p>Hahli caught him, stunned by what she had just seen. Could it really be? Could her friend have been brought back?</p>
			<p>"Jaller!" she cried.</p>
			<p>Jaller merely groaned in response, trying to take in what was happening.</p>
			<p>But the energy of re-creating the brave Matoran had taken too much out of Takutanuva. He strained against the weight of the door, but it was no use. The metal door smashed down on him, sending up a thick cloud of dust that obscured the onlookers' view.</p>
			<p>The Toa and Matoran bowed their heads sadly. Jaller stepped forward, heartbroken.</p>
			<p>"Takua!" he cried as Pewku whined sorrowfully nearby.</p>
			<p>The cloud of dust swirled vigorously. Suddenly, a figure stepped out of it-Takanuva!</p>
			<p>As Hahli gasped in surprise, Jaller raced toward his friend. Pewku ran even faster, leaping onto Takanuva with joyful cries.</p>
			<p>"You're alive!" Jaller excliamed gleefully, hardly seeming to notice his friend's new form. Then he frowned. "Kolhii-head! You could've been Makuta bones!"</p>
			<p>Takanuva grinned. "Could've been, but I'm not."</p>
			<p>Turaga Vakama raised his staff, interrupting the friends' moment. "Let us awaken the Great Spirit."</p>
			<p>Hahli, Jaller, and Takanuva followed the Turaga to the far end of the new chamber. There, a ledge plunged away into dark nothingness.</p>
			<p>"Unity!" Turaga Vakama said solemnly. "Duty! Destiny!"</p>
			<p>As he spoke, Takanuva's power illuminated his companions and himself. Their light shone down into the abyss, revealing what lay below.</p>
			<p>The Matoran gasped in amazement as they saw a strange new world stretching out below them. The chamber at the bottom of the cliff was indescribably huge-it stretched farther than the eye could see. Strange structures dotted the landscape, and flashes of energy danced here and there.</p>
			<p>Takanuva nodded as he surveyed. <i>This is it,</i> he thought as a feeling of certainty settled through him. <i>Soon we will understand everything. Who we are. Where we come from. Who sent us.</i></p>
			<p><i>Our destiny.</i></p>

			<h1>BIONICLE Adventures #1: Mystery of Metru Nui</h1>
			<h3>Greg Farshtey</h3>
			<h2>Introduction</h2>
			<p>Turaga Vakama, elder of the Mata Nui village of fire, stood on a high cliff overlooking the beach. Far below, Matoran from all over the island were hard at work constructing boats for the long journey back home.</p>
			<p>Vakama shook his head. Home. It had been so long since any of them had seen it, and the Matoran did not even remember living anywhere but Mata Nui. Only the six village elders recalled when and why they first came to the island, and for thousands of years, they had locked that secret away inside themselves.</p>
			<p>The Turaga turned at the sound of another's approach. It was Tahu Nuva, Toa of Fire and leader of the heroes of Mata Nui. "How go the labors, Turaga?" he asked.</p>
			<p>"Quite well, Toa Tahu. We will soon have enough boats to carry us all back to the island city of Metru Nui. The Po-Matoran are at work widening the tunnels so we can carry the boats to the subterranean sea."</p>
			<p>Tahu nodded as his mind flashed to the events of the past months. After the final confrontation with Makuta, master of shadows, the Toa had discovered a new island far beneath the surface of Mata Nui. It sat in the center of a silver sea of protodermis, and they could see few details of it from the shore. But Vakama insisted that this place was Metru Nui, the original home of the Matoran, to which they must return.</p>
			<p>Even more startling, the Turaga revealed that Metru Nui had once been home to six other Toa, heroes who existed long before Tahu and the others had ever appeared. But Vakama had said nothing about the fate of those early "Toa Metru", or whether they might still be waiting on Metru Nui.</p>
			<p>"I have been in council with the other Toa," said Tahu. "I have come to ask you to tell us all about this new island, Metru Nui. If we are going to journey there and protect the Matoran from any threats that might lurk in that place, we must know everything."</p>
			<p>Vakama turned and walked away from the cliff. "Indeed you must. But I will warn you, Tahu: the tales of Metru Nui are tales of sacrifice, betrayal, great danger, and yes, heroes as well. Their telling may change much of what you think you know about myself, the other Turaga, and the Matoran you have served all this time."</p>
			<p>"I-we-are prepared for that, Turaga," replied Tahu. "The Toa have gathered at the Great Temple of Kini-Nui. They wait only for you."</p>
			<p>"Then let them wait no longer, Tahu."</p>
			<p>The seven Toa-Tahu, Kopaka, Gali, Pohatu, Onua, Lewa, and Takanuva-stood silently around the Amaja Circle. The Turaga had used that sandpit and the stones within it many times to tell tales of the past and future.</p>
			<p>The Turaga of Fire placed the stone representing Mata Nui in the center of the circle and began. "In the time before time, long before any Matoran set foot on the island of Mata Nui, there was a city of legends. Hear now the first tale of Metru Nui..."</p>
			<h2>1</h2>
			<p>Kapura walked slowly along the outskirts of the district of Ta-Metru, his eyes scanning the ground. Most of the homes and factories in this part of the metru had been abandoned lately, with the residents moving closer to the heart of the district. It was Kapura's job to make sure nothing of importance had been left behind.</p>
			<p>He paused in front of a massive, blackened building that had once housed a forge. Here, construction tools and other equipment had been cast from molten protodermis before being sent on to Po-Metru for finishing. Now, in the interest of safety, that work had been transferred away from the outskirts by order of the city's elder, Turaga Dume. Kapura spotted a staff used in the sport of kolhii on the ground and bent down to pick it up, only to discover the handle was cracked.</p>
			<p>He walked on. This was an important task, his fellow workers had told him, and important tasks were best done slowly and carefully.</p>
			<p>Had Kapura looked up, he would have seen the skyline of Ta-Metru, "home of the makers." Cone-shaped factories, scorched by ages of use, stood next to the homes of smiths and crafters. These were the Matoran who molded protodermis, the substance of which everything on Metru Nui was made, into thousands of shapes and forms. A molten river of raw protodermis ran through the center of the district, drawn from below the city and fed into the Great Furnace. From there, it traveled to each factory to be turned into masks, tools, and anything else that might be needed.</p>
			<p>Dominating the skyline was the Coliseum, home to Turaga Dume and the tallest building in all of Metru Nui. For as long as anyone could remember, the sight of the Coliseum had brought a feeling of safety and security to Matoran. But now...</p>
			<p>Kapura counted slowly as he walked. Six, seven, eight-at least eight of the workers at his factory had vanished lately. Where they disappeared to, and why, no one knew. But there were plenty of rumors.</p>
			<p>The Matoran stopped. Something had moved off to the right. It didn't sound like another Matoran, or even a wild Rahi beast. It was a soft, slithering sound, as if something was dragging itself across the ground. The sound grew louder and seemed to multiply. Kapura felt the urge to run, but his feet would not move.</p>
			<p>He forced himself to turn around and look. Four thick, blackened, twisted vines were snaking their way out of cracks in the ground, weaving in the air as if momentarily unsure of what to do. Then they wrapped themselves around the empty factory and began to climb, winding around again and again until they covered the building from top to bottom.</p>
			<p>Kapura's eyes widened as the vines started to squeeze. Solid protodermis crumbled before their strength. The building groaned and cracked, collapsing in on itself in a matter of seconds. As if satisfied, the vines pulled away and began to move toward another structure.</p>
			<p>It was then that Kapura found his voice. But he could speak only one word, and that in a horrified whisper:</p>
			<p>"Morbuzakh."</p>
			<p>In another section of the city, a second Matoran was also thinking about the dreaded Morbuzakh plant. The vines had been appearing on the outskirts of the city for some time, wrecking structures and forcing residents to flee. No one knew where they came from or how to stop them. All that was known was that everyone who challenged the Morbuzakh vanished, never to be seen again.</p>
			<p>But this particular Matoran wasn't worried about the damage the plant was causing. Instead, all his attention was focused on a tablet decorated with a most interesting carving. The picture showed the combined power of six disks defeating a giant Morbuzakh root. Disks-called Kanoka in the Matoran language-were a common sight in Metru Nui. The spheres were created in every metru and used primarily for sport, as well as for defense against the wild beasts called Rahi. Disks found to be of the right purity and power level were forged into Masks of Power. But the disks in the caving could not simply be any old Kanoka, the Matoran knew. These had to be the six Great Disks of legend.</p>
			<p>Under the picture of each Great Disk was inscribed the section of the city where it could be found and the name of a Matoran: Nuhrii, Ahkmou, Vhisola, Tehutti, Ehrye, and Orkahm.</p>
			<p>When he was done examining the carving, the Matoran turned to Nidhiki, the strange, four-legged being who had brought it. "What is it I'm supposed to do?"</p>
			<p>"I would think it would be obvious," hissed Nidhiki from the shadows. "Get the six Great Disks. I dont' care how. Then give them to me and I will take them somewhere...safe."</p>
			<p>The Matoran frowned. "If they truly exist, these are the six most powerful Kanoka disks in Metru Nui. They would be beyond price. What do I get out of this?"</p>
			<p>"You will be well paid, Matoran," Nidhiki replied, smiling in a particularly nasty way. "Plus you get one more benefit, if you're successful: I won't come looking for you."</p>
			<p>"All right, all right. I get the idea. But why is this so important? Even if these Matoran could get their hands on the Great Disks, they wouldn't dare try to stop the Morbuzakh themselves."</p>
			<p>"It's not the Matoran we're worried about," came the answer. "It's so-called heroes-Toa Metru. Six Toa Metru."</p>
			<p>With that, Nidhiki was gone. The Matoran watched him go, thinking, <i>Six Toa Metru? How is that possible?</i></p>
			<p>Moments before, they had been Matoran. Six strangers, each from a different metru, brought together by a plea for help from Toa Lhikan, the hero of Metru Nui. Now, in the heart of the Great Temple in Ga-Metru, they had been transformed. Where once six Matoran had stood, there now existed six new Toa Metru.</p>
			<p>Whenua, once an archivist in Onu-Metru and now the Toa of Earth, voiced the thoughts of them all. "Since when are Matoran just zapped into Toa?"</p>
			<p>Nuju, former seer and now Toa of Ice, answered, "When uncertain times lie ahead."</p>
			<p>Vakama, Ta-Metru's most skilled mask maker and the new Toa of Fire, looked down at his new form. It was hard to believe that this new power had been granted to him. He remembered the city's protector, Toa Lhikan, giving him a powerful artifact called a Toa stone and a map to a spot in the Great Temple. Then Lhikan was captured by two strange creatures, one a four-legged foe and the other huge and powerful. Heeding his last wish, Vakama had taken the Toa stone to the temple, only to run into five other Matoran with similar missions.</p>
			<p>They placed their stones on top of the shrine dedicated to Toa. Before their eyes, the Toa stones began to pulsate and then rose into the air. Beams of elemental energy shot from them, bathing the Matoran in light, changing them, granting them power. When it was over, the Matoran had become Toa Metru, destined guardians of Metru Nui.</p>
			<p><i>But are we ready for this? Am I?</i> Vakama asked himself. He didn't have an answer.</p>
			<p>The other Toa had begun selecting their tools from a compartment inside the suva shrine. Vakama looked over what remained and chose a powerful Kanoka disk launcher. It was a larger version of what he had used in the past to play the sport of kolhii. The familiarity of it made him feel a little more comfortable in his new body.</p>
			<p>Matau, Toa of Air, chuckled. "Nice choice-for playing Matoran games, mask maker."</p>
			<p>"Hey, look at this," Onewa, the new Toa Metru of Stone, said. He reached into the tool compartment and emerged with six Kanoka disks. Each was a different color, and each bore the likeness of a Mask of Power. But what drew the attention of the new heroes was that the masks matched the ones they now wore.</p>
			<p>"What does it mean?" asked Nokama, Toa Metru of Water.</p>
			<p>"Perhaps that we were not chosen at random for this?" Vakama suggested. "Perhaps this is our destiny."</p>
			<p>"What did Toa Lhikan say we could expect, Vakama? What are we meant to do now that we are Toa?" asked Whenua. Nokama and Onewa drew in closer, anxious to hear the answer as well.</p>
			<p>"He said-" Vakama began.</p>
			<p>Then, suddenly, his mind was somewhere else. He could see day being consumed by night, Metru Nui collapsing into ruin, then miraculously restored. Six Kanoka disks flew at him from out of the darkness, forcing him to duck and dodge. They shot past him, then hovered in the air and unleashed their power on the Morbuzakh plant. Before their energies, the plant withered and died. Their task done, the Great Disks merged together to form a single one of immense power, and...</p>
			<p>Then the vision was gone. But the chill inside Vakama told him it had not just been an idle daydream. "Metru Nui was destroyed. I saw it! Six Great Kanoka Disks were headed right for me, and..."</p>
			<p>"Thanks for dream-sharing," Matau said, shaking his head.</p>
			<p>"No, we must find them. They can defeat the Morbuzakh and free the city from danger. That would prove we are worthy to be Toa Metru!" Vakama continued.</p>
			<p>The others looked at him, some doubtful, some evidently willing to believe. They had all heard the tales of the Great Disks before. It was said they contained enormous power, but the only clue to their location was that one was hidden in each metru. If the disks were used by someone with good intent, they could change the world for the better. If their user was evil, Metru Nui and all its inhabitants might be erased forever.</p>
			<p>"Then find them we shall," said Nokama. "I saw a carving in the temple that might help us. Something about finding the Great Disks by seeking the unfamiliar within the familiar. But the rest seemed to be...riddles. What do you think, Vakama?"</p>
			<p>But the Toa of Fire was not listening. In his mind's eye, he saw six Matoran, each with a Great Disk. He knew their names but could not see their faces. Worse, the shadows behind them were alive with danger. Vakama could see a pair of fierce red eyes hovering in the darkness and a four-legged creature stalking the Matoran. He had seen that figure before, in real life, struggling with Toa Lhikan. Vakama knew how powerful and evil this being was, and the memory made him shudder.</p>
			<p>"Nuhrii...Orkahm...Vhisola...Ahkmou...Ehrye...Tehutti," Vakama muttered. "They can decipher the riddles. They can help us find the Great Disks. But beware of a dark hunter who walks on four legs."</p>
			<p>"You have spent too much time at the forge, fire-spitter," answered Onewa. "Your head needs cooling down."</p>
			<p>"I trust Vakama," Nokama said. "If he believes those six Matoran can help us find the disks, then we must seek them out. When we have found them, we will meet back here. Good luck to us all."</p>
			<p><i>If my vision is true,</i> thought Vakama, <i>we will need far, far more than luck.</i></p>
			<p>The Toa Metru said their farewells and went their separate ways. Only Nokama and Vakama remained behind, staring up at the Great Temple.</p>
			<p>"Vakama, do you really think Metru Nui is in danger? Perhaps from something more frightening than the Morbuzakh?"</p>
			<p>"I know there is darkness coming," Vakama replied. "Toa Lhikan said we had to stop it. He said we had to save the 'heart of the city'. I don't know how or why, but we have been chosen."</p>
			<p>"Then may the Great Beings protect us all," said the Toa of Water.</p>
			<h2>2</h2>
			<p>Toa Nokama turned and began walking farther into Ga-Metru. All was quiet. This was traditionally the most peaceful section of Metru Nui, home to scholars and scientists. Often the only sound that could be heard was the rush of the protodermis falls.</p>
			<p>Ga-Matoran passed her on the street, looking up with awe and wonder. Some were old friends, but no one seemed to recognize her. When she did stop someone and say hello, the Matoran shied away from her and scurried off.</p>
			<p>Nokama frowned. She had never nursed any dreams of becoming a Toa. She enjoyed her life as a teacher in Ga-Metru, gaining new wisdom each day and passing it on to others. Her happiest moments had been spent in a classroom or showing her students the ancient carvings at the protodermis fountains. Now that she was a "hero", she was starting to realize what a lonely role it could be.</p>
			<p><i>At least my very first task will not be a hard one,</i> she thought. <i>Vhisola will gladly help me.</i></p>
			<p>As she walked along the canals past the beautiful temples of Ga-Metru, she remembered when she had first met her friend. Vhisola had been a student in one of Nokama's classes. The Ga-Matoran had been eager to learn, almost too eager. In her enthusiasm, she always seemed to make some mistake or other. Then she would get flustered and make another and another, until her project was a mess.</p>
			<p>Eventually, Nokama realized that if she spent extra time with Vhisola, the Matoran did better work. They became friends and still were, even if sometimes it was a stormy friendship. The more time they spent together, the more time Vhisola wanted to spend. If Nokama said she was too busy to practice kolhii or explore the canals that day, Vhisola would sulk.</p>
			<p>Their last argument had been a bad one, but Nokama was certain they had patched things up. Certainly Vhisola would not hesitate to help if she knew the fate of the city depended upon it.</p>
			<p>Nokama rapped on the door of Vhisola's small home. No one answered. When she rapped again, one of the neighbors emerged and said, "Who are you?"</p>
			<p>"I'm-" Nokama began, then hesitated. If she gave her name, she would probably have to give a longer explanation of why she was no longer a Matoran. Instead, she replied, "I'm the Toa of Water. Have you seen Vhisola?"</p>
			<p>"A Toa? Here?" said the Ga-Matoran excitedly. "I know of Toa Lhikan, of course, but I have never met a Toa up close. Where did you come from? Are you here to stay?"</p>
			<p>"Please, just answer my question. Have you seen Vhisola today?"</p>
			<p>The Ga-Matoran shook her head. "No, not lately. Is she in some trouble?"</p>
			<p>"I hope not," Nokama said. She tried the door, but it was locked. Still, she was now a Toa, and much stronger than before. A little bit of force and the door flew open.</p>
			<p>Although they had known each other a long time, Nokama had never been inside Vhisola's home. Now she saw why. Every inch of the walls was covered with carvings of Nokama, records of her achievements, copies of awards she had won. There was nothing in the room to say that Vhisola even lived there.</p>
			<p>Once the shock had passed, Nokama began to look around for any sign of where Vhisola might have gone. Her eye was caught by lights flashing on a table. Coming closer, she saw that the lights were part of a map of Ga-Metru. Certain sections lit up, flashed for an instant, then went dark again. With no better idea, Nokama moved her hand from section to section as they lit, hoping to find a pattern.</p>
			<p>There was a sound of stone grinding against stone. Then the center of the map opened up and a tablet rose from inside the table. Nokama picked it up and saw it was Vhisola's journal. She almost put it back-then she remembered the real fear in Vakama's face when he spoke of his visions. If Metru Nui was in danger, Nokama could not afford to ignore any possible clue.</p>
			<p>She scanned the last few entries and found nothing of note. But the last left her numb with fear. It read: "At first, I couldn't believe it when I heard Nokama was a Toa. Now that she is a hero, she will never have any time for me. I've spent so much time practicing my kolhii and trying to do better schoolwork, all to impress her...and now she will just want to spend time with her new Toa friends. Well, I'll show her. Once I get my hands on that Great Disk, I'll be the one people have to look up to. She will be the one they ignore!"</p>
			<p><i>She knows I am a Toa? How...? Oh, Vhisola,</i> Nokama said to herself, <i>I never meant to ignore you. You don't know the danger you could be in.</i></p>
			<p>There was no time for worry or regret. There were only two other places Vhisola spent time at, the school and the kolhii practice field. There was no practice scheduled for today, so maybe she was in class. If she wasn't, it might already be too late.</p>
			<p>Nokama turned to leave, then stopped. Out the window, she could see the familiar, spiderlike shapes of Vahki moving down the avenue. They enforced the law and kept order in Metru Nui, but even so, the sight of them had always filled Nokama with an unnamed dread. Vhisola's neighbor was talking to the squad leader.</p>
			<p><i>Maybe she sent for them,</i> Nokama thought. <i>Maybe she doesn't believe I am a Toa-especially since I can hardly believe it myself.</i></p>
			<p>The Vahki would want to bring her to Turaga Dume for questioning, and there was no time for that. She would have to get away from them.</p>
			<p>Outside the house, the Ga-Matoran neighbor was doing her best to make the Vahki understand. "She said she was a Toa. Well, how do I know that's what she is? Maybe it's some trick of the Morbuzakh. Anyway, I know my duty, so I sent for you."</p>
			<p>The Vahki nodded and signaled to the others in its squad to surround the house. Once certain that its stun staff was fully charged, it headed for Vhisola's home.</p>
			<p>Nokama chose that moment to burst out of the door. Before the Vahki could react, she rushed past him and dove into the protodermis canal. Extending her hydro blades in front of her, she knifed through the liquid. The Vahki wasted no time in pursuing, taking to the sky to follow her course.</p>
			<p>No Matoran could hope to outdistance a Vahki, but a Toa was another matter. Her Toa tools gave her an edge in speed, though she knew it would not be enough. She would have to rely on her most powerful advantage-her knowledge of Ga-Metru.</p>
			<p>Up ahead, the canal continued toward the Great Temple, but there was a narrow branch to the left that fed protodermis into a central reservoir. Nokama glanced over her shoulder. The Vahki were temporarily out of sight. She whipped around the corner and down the feeder branch, plunging into the reservoir far below.</p>
			<p>Nokama dove deep into the cool protodermis, then kicked hard and broke the surface. The reservoir was a huge, circular chamber, lit by lightstones embedded in the ceiling. Every sound echoed and re-echoed in the chamber, from the lapping of the waves to Nokama's breathing. But the one sound she did not hear was Vahki up above.</p>
			<p>Satisfied that they had given up, Nokama dove down to the bottom of the tank and swam into another feeder branch. <i>The other Toa have probably already found their Matoran,</i> she thought. <i>How they will laugh when they hear of the difficulty I had!</i></p>
			<p>Vhisola's classes were held in one of the many ornate domes that dotted Ga-Metru. Her instructor was little help but did suggest that perhaps the Matoran had closeted herself in the lab to finish some overdue work.</p>
			<p>It was only a short walk to the lab, but for some reason Nokama felt she had to run. The sight of the door blown off its hinges told her she was already too late.</p>
			<p>The inside of the lab looked worse. Furniture was overturned, tablets scattered and smashed as if a windstorm had torn through the place. A lab worker was doing his best to straighten up when Nokama entered.</p>
			<p>"What happened here?"</p>
			<p>The Matoran jumped. "Don't do that! You startled me! I thought that...thing had come back here again."</p>
			<p>"I'm sorry," Nokama said, realizing that her new appearance probably was a bit intimidating. "What 'thing' are you talking about?"</p>
			<p>"I dont' know. Four legs, some kind of claw tool-ripped the place apart. He stole all of Vhisola's research notes, all except one." The Matoran pointed to a shattered tablet on the ground.</p>
			<p>Nokama knelt down and began sifting through the fragments, matching the carvings on them together like a puzzle. When she was done, there was an image of a huge Morbuzakh root and six Great Disks bringing it down. Beneath each disk was written the metru it came from and a three-digit code.</p>
			<p><i>Vakama was right! There is a connection between the Great Disks and the Morbuzakh. But why would anyone want to stop us from ending that threat?</i></p>
			<p>Then she caught sight of something else, half hidden by an overturned bench. It was a map of the Le-Metru chute system, stamped with the name Orkahm. <i>What would this be doing here?</i> Nokama wondered.</p>
			<p>She looked up at the lab worker, who was watching her intently. "The rest of her notes-have you seen them?"</p>
			<p>"Hey, I just take care of the lab. I never-"</p>
			<p>Nokama rose to her full height. Looking down on the Matoran, she repeated slowly, "Have you seen them?"</p>
			<p>The Matoran's gaze dropped to the floor. "All right. She showed them to me once. Said something about a Great Disk making her somebody. Her notes were all about the Morbuzahkh, but they didn't make any sense to me. She made copies of everything and said she was taking them home."</p>
			<p>"For the sake of Ga-Metru and the whole city, I hope they are still there," said Nokama.</p>
			<p>She returned to Vhisola's home through the canals. As she feared, there was still a Vahki patrolling the area. Reasoning with it would be a waste of time. Vahki didn't listen. They were trained to see movement and to react. She needed a distraction.</p>
			<p><i>Well, I am supposed to be the Toa of Water,</i> she said to herself. <i>Let us see if that is only a name.</i></p>
			<p>It was the hardest thing Nokama had ever attempted. Extending her twin tools, she strained to draw moisture from the air. At one point, she thought sure she would black out and drift away on the canal. But, finally, she could feel one of the most powerful of elements coming under her control.</p>
			<p>Two narrow streams of water were all she could manage at first, but they were enough. She targeted a bit of ornamentation on a house down the avenue. The water struck it head-on, knocking it from its perch with a resounding crash. The Vahki paused, turned, and moved off to investigate.</p>
			<p>Nokama bolted for the house. Inside, she searched frantically for any possible hiding place. The four-legged creature had obviously not been here, unless he had suddenly grown neater. But where had Vhisola hidden the notes? What would be the one place that would be special to her?</p>
			<p>Then her eyes settled on the largest picture of herself. Nokama almost dreaded being proven right, but she was-behind the picture was a safe with three dials. There was no time to try to guess the combination. It had to be one of the codes that had been on the tablet, or her search would end in failure.</p>
			<p>At first, she considered using the Ga-Metru code, but that almost seemed too obvious. She tried the Ta-Metru code, the Onu-Metru code, the Po-Metru coed, and the others, all to no end. But when she spun the dial to the three digits of the Ga-Metru code, the door swung open. Inside was a pile of tablets, all with Vhisola's distinctive carvings on them. Nokama glanced at each one until she found the crucial piece of information.</p>
			<p>It was a carving of the Great Temple with a powerful disk pictured beside it. It had been there all the time!</p>
			<p><i>Vhisola must have gone there to retrieve the Great Disk,</i> thought Nokama. <i>But if she doesn't know about that four-legged monster...</i></p>
			<p>Nokama turned and raced out of the house. She didn't even worry that the Vahki might pursue her again. <i>Let it follow me! I could use the help!</i></p>
			<p>As she sped through the canals heading for the Great Temple, Nokama remembered one of her first conversations with Vhisola. "Everyone has a special talent," she had told the Matoran. "You simply have to discover the one that is yours."</p>
			<p>Now that she knew Vhisola's plan had been to take the Great Disk for herself and use it for personal gain, she wondered if the Matoran's "special talent" was deception.</p>
			<p>She emerged from the canals near the temple but was stopped short by the sight of a crowd of Matoran some distance away. They were craning their necks to look up at one of the tall buildings, pointing and shouting.</p>
			<p>Nokama rushed over to them. "What is it? What's happening?"</p>
			<p>"It's Vhisola!" one shouted. "On top of that building! She's going to fall!"</p>
			<p>The Toa of Water looked up. There was Vhisola, teetering on the edge of a roof. The Matoran wasn't going to be able to maintain her balance for long. Nokama felt helpless. She wasn't a climber, she could never scale the building in time.</p>
			<p>She turned and leaped into the canal, extending her hydro blades in front of her. Her momentum carried her forward, skiing across the surface of the canal. Just before reaching a bridge, Nokama dove beneath the surface. She sped through the winding protodermis pipe, down a grade, and back up at incredible velocity. Powered by her fear for Vhisola's life, she flew out of the end of the pipe and soared high into the air, angling her body so she would land on the same roof as the Matoran.</p>
			<p>Vhisola saw her coming, rocked a little, and started to fall. Nokama swooped down, caught the Matoran with one arm and the edge of the roof with the other, and hauled them both to safety.</p>
			<p>If she expected gratitude, she was disappointed. "You," said Vhisola. "I knew it would be you. Now that you're a Toa Metru, you'll just cast an even longer shadow over me."</p>
			<p>"Vhisola, whatever you think, we can deal with it later. I need that Great Disk!"</p>
			<p>"Everyone wants my disk," said Vhisola. "Some four-legged thing-not a Rahi, I don't know what it was-chased me through the streets. I had to hide up here to get away from him. I never should have paid attention to that note."</p>
			<p>"What note?"</p>
			<p>Vhisola produced two small tablets. On the first was a jumble of Matoran numbers, on the second a code key. "Here. Let's see if you can decode it faster than I did."</p>
			<p>It took Nokama a few long moments, but finally she was able to read the message. It said: "Beware. The Toa serve the Morbuzakh. They must not find the Great Disks. Meet me at the protodermis falls with your disk and I will keep it safe. Ahkmou."</p>
			<p>Nokama suddenly felt very cold. "Come on, Vhisola. We need to have a long talk with some friends of mine."</p>
			<h2>3</h2>
			<p>Ask a Ga-Matoran or a Ko-Matoran, and they would say Ta-Metru was the harshest, least hospitable spot in all of Metru Nui. The searing heat of the forges and the Great Furnace, the heavy smell of molten protodermis, the constant sound of crafters hammering away-to Matoran from the quieter districts, Ta-Metru was a nightmare.</p>
			<p>Vakama, Toa of Fire, would have agreed with that opinion right now, if he'd had a moment to think. Instead, he was diving and rolling to avoid white-hot protodermis flowing from a vat high above. An accidental overflow or leak was always bad news, but in this case, it was far worse than that.</p>
			<p>Vakama glanced up. Yes, the Morbuzakh vines were still there, trying hard to rip the protodermis vat off its chain and hurl it to the ground. If they succeeded, there might not be much left of this section of Ta-Metru.</p>
			<p>The Toa's mind raced. Morbuzakh vines had never been seen this far inside a metru. Protodermis vats on their way to a forge should never stall long enough for anything to grab hold of them. But both had happened, and just when Vakama arrived in search of a missing mask maker.</p>
			<p>Ta-Matoran workers were running for cover. But if enough hot protodermis hit the ground, there would be no place to hide. It would burn through anything in its path unless Vakama found a way to stop it.</p>
			<p><i>Right. Sounds easy,</i> thought the new Toa Metru. <i>Only how do I do it? I can't keep ducking and dodging. The vat is too high up to reach by climbing. Not that the Morbuzakh will let me get close enough anyway. Unless...</i></p>
			<p>Matau had made fun of his choice of a disk launcher for a Toa tool. But right now, Vakama felt like it was the wisest decision he had ever made. He looked at the three-digit code on one of his disks. The first digit identified where it was made, the second its power, the third its power level. This was a level 5 freeze disk. Better still, the disk had been made in Ko-Metru, which meant it carried an extra surprise for the Morbuzakh vines.</p>
			<p>Vakama rolled, came up in a crouch, aimed, and let the disk fly. As he expected, the Morbuzakh vines reacted instantly, swiping at the spinning object. But Ko-Metru disks were made to swerve at high speed to avoid any obstacle. The Morbuzakh grasped only empty air as the disk flew onto its target.</p>
			<p>Impact! The disk hit the gears above the vat head on, freezing them solid and stopping the tilt. The vines snaked back up to the vat but recoiled violently when they touched the ice.</p>
			<p>Vakama took the hint. He launched another disk at one of the vines. When it struck, veins of frost began to travel the length of the blackened tendril. The other vines writhed frantically in the air, then all of them retreated back through a crack in the ground.</p>
			<p>The Toa Metru of Fire let out a long sigh of relief. The forge was safe, and more importantly, he had learned that Morbuzakh hated the cold. He was puzzling over what that might mean when the control room attendant came rushing over.</p>
			<p>"That was...amazing!" said the Ta-Matoran. "I thought we had seen the last of the Toa when Lhikan disappeared. If you hadn't been here-"</p>
			<p>"I did what I had to do," said Vakama quietly. He wasn't used to being seen as a hero and wasn't sure if he would ever feel comfortable about being one. "What happened? I thought that the vats never stopped moving."</p>
			<p>"Come and see," said the attendant grimly. Vakama followed him into the forge control center. The foreman pointed to an ugly burn on one of the panels. "That's what happened. Some four-legged monster broke in and fried the controls with a burst of energy."</p>
			<p>Vakama knelt down for a closer look. Some components had been damaged, but they could be repaired. That was not half as interesting as the scattered protodermis dust he saw on the floor near the damaged portion. He had seen dust like that once before, on a visit to Po-Metru, but this glittered in the light. It was only upon closer examination that he spotted the crushed Ko-Metru knowledge crystals mixed in with the dust.</p>
			<p>The Toa Metru glanced up at the attendant. "I think I can fix this, if you can do a favor for me. I'm looking for a mask maker named Nuhrii. He wasn't at his home or at his forge. Have you seen him?"</p>
			<p>"Yes. He was here this morning," the attendant replied. "He was looking for a Great Mask he made. It was tossed as flawed, but he said someone told him the mask was fine. He wanted to retrieve it before it went into the furnace for meltdown."</p>
			<p>"Did he find it?"</p>
			<p>"It's not here. Must still be on the reject pile, so I sent him over there. Nuhrii was talking pretty crazy, though. Said if he couldn't find the mask, he knew where there was a Kanoka disk that could make the greatest mask anyone had ever worn. I guess he's been working a little too hard."</p>
			<p>"Yes, I guess so," Vakama replied, not at all convinced Nuhrii was crazy. More likely, the Matoran was walking into a trap-or getting ready to spring one.</p>
			<p>The Toa of Fire thought hard as he walked. The walls of Nuhrii's home had been lined with tablets, souvenirs of his work. Each tablet showed an image of a Kanohi mask and the Kanoka disk from which it had been made. One of the tablets had been smashed on the floor, and a failed attempt made to put it back together.</p>
			<p>The forge attendant had said Nuhrii had made a flawed mask. Vakama guessed it was the tablet featuring that mask that had been broken in anger. When Nuhrii heard the mask was in fact perfect, he tried to put the tablet back together before rushing off to find the Kanohi.</p>
			<p>That still left a few questions. Who had discovered the mask was still a good one and notified Nuhrii? And was the note the Matoran had received the truth or simply bait to lure him into a trap?</p>
			<p>Vakama hoped to find the answer at the huge, fenced-in lot just ahead. Its official name was Protodermis Reclamation Center, but to every mask maker in Ta-Metru, it was a graveyard. No matter how many hours of work had gone into a mask, a single, tiny flaw could ruin it. Then it would be transported here, to sit on top of a pile of other broken, useless masks until it could be fed to the furnace and melted down. It was the one place no mask maker ever wanted to visit.</p>
			<p>A single guard stood at the gate. The bored look on his face disappeared when he saw a Toa coming toward him. "Who are you?" he asked.</p>
			<p>"I am Toa Vakama." It felt so strange to say it. "Toa Metru of Fire. I need to get inside."</p>
			<p>"I'm sorry, but I have orders from Turaga Dume. No one is allowed in. I don't want trouble with the Vahki."</p>
			<p>"But you let Nuhrii in, didn't you? He's in danger, and I have to find him. Please open the gate."</p>
			<p>"I can't! I could lose my job."</p>
			<p>Vakama frowned. The argument was taking too much time. The guard was obviously more afraid of the Vahki than he was of making a Toa angry. <i>And why wouldn't he be? No Toa would ever harm an innocent.</i></p>
			<p>"Then I will open it for you," the Toa of Fire said. Concentrating harder than he ever had in his life, Vakama willed a narrow jet of flame from his hand. In an instant it had melted the lock into slag. "You did your job. Now I have to try and do mine."</p>
			<p>The yard was quiet. Vakama walked past piles of Kanohi masks and other artifacts, all waiting behind the fences for their time in the Great Furnace. Some looked perfect to the naked eye, their flaws visible only to a truly skilled crafter. Others were badly mangled.</p>
			<p>So focused was he on scanning the damaged items that he almost tripped over something in his path. When he regained his footing, he saw it was a Mask of Shielding someone had left lying in the path. Vakama bent down and picked it up. It looked familiar somehow, but he couldn't quite place it.</p>
			<p>Then it struck him. The angle of the mask, the ridges around the eyepieces-these were marks of Nuhrii's work. Was this the mask the Matoran had been seeking, now cast aside as if it were worthless?</p>
			<p>"Everyone seems to want that Kanohi today," said a Matoran behind him. Vakama turned to see the reclamation center caretaker approaching. "Nuhrii was here looking for it just a short while ago."</p>
			<p>"But he didn't take it with him?" asked Vakama. "Why not?"</p>
			<p>"Look for yourself. That mask has a hairline crack in the base," the caretaker replied, pointing to a barely visible flaw. "I'v been doing this so long I can spot a bad one from a long way away. Mask maker must have cooled it too fast. Anyway, Nuhrii took one look at it, threw it down, and left. He was muttering something about forging the most powerful Kanohi ever made and showing up some other crafter. Vakama, I think his name was."</p>
			<p><i>Me? Why would he want to outdo me?</i> Vakama thought. <i>Sure, I had fewer masks wind up here, and Turaga Dume did ask me to craft a special Kanohi for him. But I never knew Nuhrii would be so jealous of that. After all, I learned so much from him.</i></p>
			<p>"I guess masks aren't the only things that can hide their flaws," the Toa of Fire said. "Do you have any idea where he's gone?"</p>
			<p>The caretaker handed over a tablet. "He dropped this on his way out."</p>
			<p>Vakama's eyes flew across the stone. There was no signature on the note, just some smudges of liquid protodermis. It read:</p>
			<p><i>Nuhrii,</i></p>
			<p><i>Come to the abandoned mask maker's house in the northern reaches. You'll learn a valuable secret there-how to turn a Great Disk into a Kanohi mask that will live in legend. Come alone. Tell no one.</i></p>
			<p>Vakama's mind reeled for a moment. He could see Nuhrii surrounded by shadowy tentacles that were reaching for him, grabbing him, squeezing the breath from the Matoran. Somehow, the Toa knew this danger was real, and it was happening now!</p>
			<p>The caretaker watched Vakama race off and shook his head. Then he turned to a pile of broken masks and said, "Everyone's in such a hurry. Everyone except me...and all of you. We're in no rush to get where we're going, right?"</p>
			<p>The Matoran laughed then, but Vakama was too far away to hear.</p>
			<p>The Toa of Fire scanned his surroundings. He couldn't believe anything could make Nuhrii come here. This was a place no Ta-Matoran ever wandered, not if they hoped to see the twin suns rise again.</p>
			<p>This had once been one of the most active sections of Ta-Metru. Vakama could remember riding the chutes here to see friends just a short time ago, but it seemed like ages had passed. Now the whole neighborhood was desolate and abandoned, surrendered to the power of the Morbuzakh. Half the buildings were reduced to rubble, and the rest did not look much better.</p>
			<p>Vakama walked carefully, avoiding the chunks of solid protodermis that littered the street. Only the skittering of little Rahi among the wreckage broke the silence. Most of the Matoran who had lived here had fled, finding refuge with friends in the heart of the metru. Those who had chosen to stay were never seen or heard from again. Turaga Dume had declared the whole area off-limits, but soon found he did not need to dispatch Vahki to guard the place. No Matoran wanted to travel here.</p>
			<p><i>Except Nuhrii,</i> Vakama reminded himself. <i>But even if he is here, I may be too late to save him.</i></p>
			<p>As if in answer, a voice shouted. "Help!" It came from an abandoned crafter's home farther down the street. Vakama broke into a run, then stopped short when he saw the twin Morbuzakh vines slithering toward the same building. They were moving too quickly. He could never hope to outrace them.</p>
			<p>"Help!"</p>
			<p>Vakama loaded his last disk into the launcher and hoped he was making the right decision. He had never used this particular kind of disk before or even forged a mask from one. Its power was the least predictable and might make a bad situation worse. But there wasn't any other choice.</p>
			<p>The disk shot through the air and struck the first vine, then began a sweeping arc that would bring it back to Vakama. On its way, it clipped the second vine, just as the Toa Metru had hoped it would. Before his eyes, both vines began to shimmer and fade. Then they were gone, teleported somewhere else in Metru Nui. Vakama hoped he had not just created a greater danger for someone else to deal with.</p>
			<p>The door to the house was unlocked. As soon as it was opened, a cloud of protodermis dust flew out, blinding and choking Vakama. When he could see again, he discovered the way in was blocked by rubble.</p>
			<p>"Who's there? Help me! I'm trapped back here!" It was Nuhrii's voice, coming from somewhere beyond the pile of protodermis. The Morbuzakh vines had brought down the roof and were no doubt getting ready to start on the walls when the Toa Metru showed up.</p>
			<p>For a moment, Vakama considered using his elemental power to melt through the obstacle. But his powers were so new, he had too little control over them. Make a mistake and the whole district might burn. No, he would have to do it the hard way, block by block.</p>
			<p>Vakama removed one chunk of protodermis, but when he took out a second, the rubble shifted and more fell from the roof. "Hey, watch it!" Nuhrii shouted. "What are you trying to do?"</p>
			<p>Vakama began again, proceeding more carefully. He shifted a block, paused, shifted it some more, until he was certain it wouldn't cause a collapse. It took a lot of careful work, but he finally managed to create a big enough opening for Nuhrii to crawl through. The Matoran was coated in dust but did not seem hurt.</p>
			<p>"I thought I would never get out of there," said Nuhrii. Then he looked up at his rescuer for the first time. "Vakama! You!"</p>
			<p>"Are you all right? What were you doing here?"</p>
			<p>"Okay, why shouldn't I tell you? I came here to learn how to turn a Great Disk into a Mask of Power you could never dream of making. Then I would be the one others came to for important Kanohi."</p>
			<p>In all the time Vakama had worked as a mask maker, he had never once raised his voice. It had been Nuhrii who first hired him as a mask-making apprentice, and Nuhrii who had taught him the basic skills. But now, as Vakama thought of all he had been through to find the Matoran, he felt anger rise in him.</p>
			<p>"Look around you, Nuhrii," the Toa said harshly. "Look at what the Morbuzakh has done to our city! This is no time to be thinking of personal glory. Everyone has to work together to stop this menace. That Great Disk you have is the key to saving Metru Nui. I don't know how, but it is. You have to tell me where to find it!"</p>
			<p>Nuhrii looked shocked. It took him a moment before he could speak, but when he did, his tone was that of a Matoran ashamed. "The Great Disk? I-I didn't know. Yes, I will gladly help you find it."</p>
			<p>The two left the house and started walking out of the abandoned zone. Although Nuhrii spoke under his breath, Vakama could hear him saying, "We'll get the disk. We'll stop the Morbuzakh. And everyone will know that I saved Metru Nui!"</p>
			<p>The Toa Metru of Fire could only shake his head and walk on.</p>
			<h2>4</h2>
			<p>Whenua stood before the south gate of the Onu-Metru Archives, about at the end of his patience. "All right. For the fourth time, I am Whenua. I worked here my whole life. I need to get inside and find Tehutti before he does something we are all going to regret a whole lot."</p>
			<p>He waited for an answer from the gate guard, who did not look impressed by the sight of a Toa Metru of Earth. Whenua considered finding another access to the Archives, but given that they covered almost the entire metru, it could be a long chute ride to another gateway. And there was no guarantee the guard there would be any more cooperative.</p>
			<p>"Okay, you look like a Toa," said the guard. "But not any Toa I've ever seen. And Whenua? Whenua is an archivist, and he sure doesn't carry twin drills like yours. If you don't want to give me your real name, fine, but I can't let just anyone in here."</p>
			<p>Whenua did his best to hold his temper. It would take too long to explain about how artifacts called Toa stones transformed six Matoran into Toa Metru, even assuming the guard would believe that. Even more frustrating was the fact that his Great Mask of Power might prove a help here, but he didn't even know what that power might be yet.</p>
			<p>"Can you at least tell me if Tehutti is here?"</p>
			<p>The guard chuckled. "Tehutti's always here, Toa 'Whenua'. He spends his whole life down with the exhibits. He showed up here all excited about some shipment or another, probably another Rahi only its mother could love. But there's nothing on the ship schedule for today."</p>
			<p>Whenua frowned. When he had first found out Tehutti was missing, he went to the archivist's home. There he found a note offering an exotic Rahi for the Archives in exchange for a Great Disk. The note featured a crude drawing of the Rahi and was signed by a Ga-Metru Matoran named Vhisola. From the sound of things, Tehutti had rushed right over to make the exchange.</p>
			<p>The Toa Metru of Earth made his decision. He pushed past the guard and went to the doorway. "Call the Vahki if you want to, I have to get in there. Now where did they hide those levers today?"</p>
			<p>While the guard protested, Whenua ran his hands over the surface of the doorway. The Archives boasted a unique security system. Each door had three hidden levers whose location was changed every day. They had to be thrown in the right combination for the door to open, and that changed every day, too. Every Onu-Matoran believed it to be the perfect protection against intruders.</p>
			<p>"Go ahead," said the guard. "No one has ever made it past that door. You won't stand a-"</p>
			<p>Whenua threw the levers, one, two, three. The great door opened with a hiss. The Toa of Earth turned toward the guard and said, "What was that? Couldn't hear you over the door opening."</p>
			<p>	*	*	*</p>
			<p>To Whenua, the Onu-Metru Archives were more than a storehouse or a museum. In his eyes, they were more magnificent than the crystal Knowledge Towers of Ko-Metru, the Great Temple, and the sculpture fields of Po-Metru all put together. The main floors extended for a great distance in every direction, and when they had taken up most of the space in the metru, work had begun on the lower levels and subbasements. The Archives now occupied the subterranean depths of the city, extending far beyond the boundaries of Onu-Metru.</p>
			<p>Nor could it be said that the Archives were "finished". As more exhibits were added, Onu-Matoran workers continued to dig deeper and deeper down to find space to house them. Over time, they and the archivists had become so accustomed to the dim light underground that the brightness of the twin suns was hard on their eyes.</p>
			<p>On the outside, the Archives looked grim and imposing. Inside, it was a vast treasure trove of every creation that had ever walked Metru Nui. Rather than the dry historical records and prophecies of Ko-Metru, this was a living museum. Every Rahi beast, every insectlike Bohrok, every creature in the Archives was part of a living record. Inside their protodermis stasis tubes, they were alive but suspended in time forever.</p>
			<p>Whenua walked into the first of the Rahi wings, enjoying the familiar scents of the Archives. He nodded a greeting to one of the oldest exhibits, a Nui-Rama captured in flight whose stasis chamber hung from the ceiling high above. All around, archivists scurried back and forth pushing their transport carts. These were used for moving exhibits of all sizes through the subterranean, protodermis-lined tunnels.</p>
			<p>Whenua turned and headed for Tehutti's pride and joy, an exhibit of a Kane-Ra bull. Before he had even walked through the archway, he could see something was wrong. The section looked like a live Rahi had passed through, shattering the display case and scattering artifacts. Fortunately, only the outer shell had been broken. Had the inner casing been cracked, the Rahi inside might well have come to life again and rampaged through the Archives.</p>
			<p>Whenua spotted Tehutti's transport cart in a corner, empty. Lying near it was a hammer, the kind used in Ta-Metru forges. The archivist in Whenua was dismayed. Ta-Metru artifacts belonged on one of the sublevels, not in a Rahi section. It was only when he looked again at all the damage that he realized why the hammer was there.</p>
			<p><i>Who would want to sabotage these relics?</i> he wondered. <i>Someone from Ta-Metru? Why?</i></p>
			<p>Shrugging, Whenua moved on to the next exhibit hall. Here were more Rahi, even larger ones, and carvings of those that had either eluded capture or whose displays had been moved into storage. The Toa Metru of Earth was looking for anything out of place, when one carving caught his eye. It depicted a massive Rahi with four legs and a long, muscular tail, ideal for striking out at opponents. Carved underneath the picture were the words "Nui-Jaga. Found in Po-Metru, near the Sculpture Fields." Beside that was the name of the carver, Ahkmou.</p>
			<p><i>A Nui-Jaga,</i> he thought. <i>A Po-Metru Rahi. But this is the same beast Vhisola offered in trade for the Great Disk!</i></p>
			<p>As an archivist, Whenua was skilled at starting from the present and working back. No Ga-Matoran would even know what a Nui-Jaga was, most likely, let alone have one captive to trade. The offer to Tehutti had been a fake, probably written by someone other than this Vhisola. It was bait to get Tehutti to the Archives so the Great Disk could be stolen from him!</p>
			<p>That thought made him realize something even worse. Whoever was trying to get the Great Disks-possibly that four-legged hunter Vakama talked about-might be right here in the Archives, planning an ambush. For a moment, he wondered if he should try to find help. Maybe a Toa, or even the Vahki...</p>
			<p>Then he remembered-he <i>was</i> a Toa. It was his job to face danger and overcome it. And nothing-<i>nothing!</i>-would make him risk the safety of his Archives or his city.</p>
			<p>He ran for the nearest exit to the outer dock. Still getting used to his new, far more powerful form, he stumbled a few times and almost crashed into a display of parasitic krana. With a shudder, he kept going, thanking the Great Beings he had not set those <i>things</i> loose.</p>
			<p>Any shipment, no matter how large or small, had to come through the outer dock. The Matoran who worked here were both smart and brave. It was their job to make sure every "exhibit" was ready to be place in a stasis tube, where its life processes would be slowed to a crawl. If one of the creatures intended for archiving decided to wake up, it would be up to the dockworkers to put it back to sleep again.</p>
			<p>When Whenua arrived on the dock, a four-Matoran crew was trying to subdue a Gukko bird long enough for it to be put in stasis and archived. The powerful winged beast was objecting. There was about a fifty-fifty chance it would break away and head for the sky, carrying a Matoran or two with it.</p>
			<p>Whenua went over to help, but the dock leader got in the way. "We have to do it ourselves," said the Matoran. "Understand? If we start depending on a Toa, what happens when you're not around?"</p>
			<p>Whenua looked from the dock leader to the crew and back again. Then he nodded. "Okay, then-for now. Have you seen Tehutti?"</p>
			<p>"He was headed for the next dock over. I told him not to waste his time. This Rahi was a last-minute find, but there aren't any others on the schedule. And nothing from any Vhisola."</p>
			<p>"I know. I'm pretty sure he knows, too," replied Whenua, turning away. "Make sure that Gukko's fast asleep. Last time one got loose, it brought down half the exhibits in sublevel three."</p>
			<p>"How did you know about that?" the dock leader asked. But the Toa of Earth was already gone.</p>
			<p>	*	*	*</p>
			<p>Whenua pounded around the corner. All he could think about was finding Tehutti in time and stopping him from doing something the whole city would regret later. He scanned for any sign of the Matoran or for signs of a trap.</p>
			<p>What he found was a well-concealed hole with a narrow ladder leading down into darkness. On a hunch, he began to climb down. He had made it about halfway when a rung gave way beneath his foot.</p>
			<p>The next thing he knew, he was falling. And falling. Down, down, into the sublevels and sublevels of the Archives, and then farther still, thinking to himself all the while: <i>Stupid. Stupid, stupid, stupid!</i></p>
			<p>Thoughts rushed through his mind. Was this the trap set for Tehutti, and had the Matoran already fallen into it? Just how far down did this pit go? And could even a Toa survive such a plunge?</p>
			<p>Whenua found out an instant later, when he came to a crashing halt far below the lowest levels of the Archives. Despite spending a lifetime working here, even he had never been this far down before. But he had heard rumors of a level far below the surface, where exhibits that had proven potentially dangerous were placed for safekeeping.</p>
			<p>The Toa Metru of Earth sat up and groaned. His bruises had bruises and his head was pounding. With a great deal of effort, he rose.</p>
			<p>The hallways down here were even darker and more narrow than the ones above. Lightstones were few and far between. Anyone who came down here left in a hurry, so why waste illumination?</p>
			<p>He had only taken three steps when he heard the sound every archivist dreads. It was a unique crunch, the sound of stasis-tube fragments being crushed underfoot.</p>
			<p>Whenua forced himself to remain calm. <i>So one of the cases was broken, so what? Maybe it's only the outer shell that was damaged, and there's nothing to worry about. Yes, it had to be the outer shell, because if it was the inner shell, then something would be loose down here. Something very nasty.</i></p>
			<p>He had seen it happen before. Outer shells could take all kinds of pounding, but if the inner shell of a stasis tube cracked even a little, the rush of air would wake up the contents. When the contents had teeth, claws, and a hatred of being caged up, this generally turned out to be a bad thing.</p>
			<p>Whenua did his best to move quietly down the corridor, not easy with his large frame. He reminded himself that he had been an experienced Onu-Metru archivist before becoming a Toa. As a Matoran, he had faced down his share of snarling Rahi. What could be down here that could possibly bother him now?</p>
			<p>The answer came with twin beams of pure, blazing heat that creased the side of his Kanohi mask. The wall of the corridor sizzled where they struck, and the hallway was suddenly filled with the smell of charred protodermis. Whenua whirled to see a Rahkshi heading right toward him, red eyes gleaming in its hideous yellow face.</p>
			<p>Startled, he found he could not remember the creature's exact name. But he didn't have to strain to recall its power-heat vision, capable of burning a hole through anything, including newly created Toa. No one was quite certain just where Rahkshi came from, but everyone wished they had stayed there.</p>
			<p>Whenua ducked another heat blast and darted into another corridor. He needed time to think and space to maneuver, neither of which the Rahkshi was likely to give him. This would be a great time to use his Kanohi Mask of Power, if only he knew what it did. The twin earthshock drills he carried could punch their way through almost anything, and his elemental power...</p>
			<p>Yes, that was it. When he reached the far end of the hall, he activated the drills and began tearing up the flooring. His elemental power would affect the earth underneath, but there was no harm giving it a little help.</p>
			<p>The Rahkshi turned the corner and started toward him, its powerful body gleaming in the dim light. He could hear the horrible screech of the kraata it carried inside. Twin shafts of red shot toward him from the Rahkshi's eyes, Whenua barely moving aside in time. Then it was the moment to go to work.</p>
			<p>The Toa Metru looked down and did his best to ignore the advancing creature. He willed the earth to rise, to form an impenetrable wall between him and the Rahkshi. He could see the soil beginning to shift, running together and then swirling as if mini cyclones had taken hold.</p>
			<p>It was a toss-up who was more shocked by what happened next, the Rahkshi or Whenua. A mound of earth suddenly rose from the floor, hardening rapidly and blocking the creature from coming closer. Whenua took a step back and smiled, imagining how the other Toa would feel when he told them about this. Nuju probably couldn't even manage an icicle, or Onewa move a pebble, or...</p>
			<p>The celebration came to an abrupt end. Twin red spots appeared on the earth wall, glowing brighter and brighter every moment. While Whenua had been patting himself on the back, the Rahkshi was focusing its power to melt the obstacle in its path.</p>
			<p><i>Okay, maybe I wont' tell the others about this,</i> Whenua decided.</p>
			<p>He ducked into a doorway just as the wall crumbled. There was something Tehutti had said about yellow Rahkshi once, if only he could remember. What was it? Tehutti was always on about one piece of exhibit trivia or another.</p>
			<p>Then it came to him. Right after it uses its heat beams, the Rahkshi's eyesight is weakened temporarily. Tehutti had been right, too, for the creature walked right past Whenua's hiding place without spotting him.</p>
			<p>Once the Rahkshi was gone, Whenua fought a strong urge to get out of the Archives. Then he remembered that Tehutti might well be down here, and if he was, the Rahkshi would find him. Like it or not, he had to go on.</p>
			<p><i>But maybe I don't have to fight the Rahkshi,</i> he realized. <i>Not if I can get something else to do it for me.</i></p>
			<p>Whenua raced down the hallway, stopping only long enough to pry a lightstone out of the wall. By its beam, he was able to spot the shattered Rahkshi stasis tube. He scooped up as many of the inner casing fragments as he could find, then went back on the trail of the creature.</p>
			<p>As he walked, he tried to remember everything he could about this level. Over time, he had seen a number of exhibits sent down here, even marked a few for storage himself. If he was correct, all he had to do was find the right one.</p>
			<p>It took a lot of walking, numerous twists and turns, and a few potentially dangerous mistakes before Whenua spotted the door he wanted. It was one of the few down here that had a sign, which read <b>DANGER: MUAKA PEN</b>. He could hear the great Rahi cat pacing and growling behind the door. Food was sent down to it once a day from the upper levels through a small chute, but Muaka were notorious for always being hungry. Better still, they did not get along with Rahkshi at all.</p>
			<p>Whenua took a deep breath. This was going to be tricky. First, he scattered the protodermis fragments on the floor in front of the door. Then he used his earthshock drill to punch a hole through the lock. He waited until he could hear the Muaka charging before he dove for cover.</p>
			<p>The door crashed open. The huge Rahi snarled, sniffing the air and snapping its massive jaws together. Whenua watched anxiously as the Muaka lowered its head and picked up the scent off the fragments. The beast's eyes narrowed at the smell of Rahkshi, and it took off at a run.</p>
			<p>Whenua followed. Letting another creature loose down here went against his nature as an archivist, but it would be easier to cage the Muaka again than a Rahkshi. He just had to hope the Muaka found the Rahkshi before either found Tehutti.</p>
			<p>He was deep in the heart of the storage level when he heard the snarls up ahead. The sounds were followed by red flashes of heat vision, then an impact that shook the entire section. The Muaka had tracked down his prey.</p>
			<p>Whenua rounded the corner to see Rahi and Rahkshi locked in a mighty struggle. Ordinarily, the Rahkshi would be the clear favorite, but the Muaka's bulk reduced his foe's room to maneuver. Beyond them, the Toa could see an open chamber where Tehutti strained to get out from under a pile of artifacts.</p>
			<p>The Toa forced himself to wait for the right moment. When Muaka lifted his right forepaw to strike, Whenua dove, slid across the floor past the two creatures, and ended up in the same chamber as the Matoran.</p>
			<p>"Get me out of here!" Tehutti cried. "I'll do anything!"</p>
			<p>Whenua worked quickly and carefully, pushing the debris aside and hoping the struggle outside would go on a little longer. "Anything? Then how about giving me that Great Disk you have while there's still a city up above to save."</p>
			<p>Tehutti shrugged off the last few pieces of Metru Nui history and nodded. "I never thought I would be glad tos ee you. I fell down here, and some four-legged Rahi bait demanded I give him the disk. When I wouldn't do it, he brought this stuff down on me and left me there. You want the disk? You can have it. I'd rather be trapped in a broken chute with a horde of Vahki than hold on to it now!"</p>
			<p>Whenua glanced out into the hall, made sure Rahi and Rahkshi were still busy, then slammed the door and locked it. "We'll have to dig a new tunnel to get out of here. In the meantime, you can explain why you ever thought a Ga-Matoran would have a Nui-Jaga to trade for the disk."</p>
			<p>Tehutti watched in awe as Whenua's earthshock drills went to work on the wall. "I-I knew she wouldn't. My friend Ahkmou told me all about Nui-Jaga long ago, so I knew they didn't come from Ga-Metru. I wanted to see why someone wanted the Great Disk...and if they really did have a Nui-Jaga, well..."</p>
			<p>"You would have traded the city's safety for a new exhibit to put your name on," Whenua replied.</p>
			<p>"With you for a Toa Metru, Whenua, how safe is the city now?" Tehutti said. "Besides, nothing very bad is going to happen to Metru Nui. Turaga Dume will figure out some way to deal with the Morbuzakh and everything will be fine."</p>
			<p>"I hope so." Whenua powered down his drills. He had managed to punch a good-size hole in the wall. On the other side was another darkened corridor with a distinct upward slope. Hopefully, it led to the main floors.</p>
			<p>"Let's go," said the Toa of Earth. "We have a long journey ahead. If we run into the Morbuzakh, make sure to tell it that it's not a threat. I've never seen a plant laugh before."</p>
			<h2>5</h2>
			<p>The Matoran put down his tools and stood very still. He had heard two sets of footsteps behind him, heavy footsteps, and he really did not want to turn around and see who it might be.</p>
			<p>"Well, well, well," hissed a too-familiar voice. "Here I am again."</p>
			<p>The Matoran forced himself to look. Yes, it was Nidhiki again, this time accompanied by a hulking brute with energy crackling from his hands.</p>
			<p>"I came back to get the Great Disks," Nidhiki continued. "You know, the ones I want <i>very badly</i>? The ones you promised to get for me?"</p>
			<p>"I-I don't have them. Not yet," the Matoran stammered. "But I'll get them! It's just taking a little more time than I thought."</p>
			<p>"I see," Nidhiki replied. He gestured with one of his legs, and his lumbering companion moved toward the Matoran. "This is my friend. He doesn't like Matoran. He particularly doesn't like you."</p>
			<p>The Matoran looked up at the bestial face of the brute who towered over him. "I'm doing my best! Really!"</p>
			<p>"Your best?" Nidhiki repeated. "Three of the Toa are close to finding the Great Disks. Your efforts to trap the Matoran and divert the Toa Metru have been failures. Do you know what that means?"</p>
			<p>The Matoran swallowed hard as the two creatures crowded close to him. "N-n-no."</p>
			<p>"It means you're going to do better than your best. I've been to Ko-Metru and arranged to keep Toa Nuju busy. I expect you to arrange a little surprise for Toa Matau and get the Le-Metru disk. I know you aren't foolish enough to disappoint me again, are you?"</p>
			<p>The Matoran shook his head. He wanted to say something, but his mouth didn't seem to be working.</p>
			<p>"Good. Then I hope the next time I see you, you will have all six Great Disks for me. But either way," Nidhiki added smiling, "it will be the last time I see you, Matoran. Understand?"</p>
			<p>The two left before the Matoran could answer. They were barely out the door before he gathered up his things and headed for the chute station. He had an appointment in Le-Metru that he wouldn't miss if his life depended on it.</p>
			<p><i>And it sounds like it does!</i> the Matoran thought as he dashed out into the street.</p>
			<h2>6</h2>
			<p>From high atop a gleaming Knowledge Tower, Nuju looked down upon the landscape of Ko-Metru. For the Toa Metru of Ice, this was a most unusual vantage point. Normally, his eyes were on the sky, seeking to read the future from the brighness and movement of the stars.</p>
			<p>But if Vakama was right, there might not be much of a future for Metru Nui if the Great Disks were not found. It was true that the Morbuzakh plant had done some pretty serious damage to the metru. Still, Nuju was not sure just how far he wished to trust the Toa of Fire's "visions".</p>
			<p>Down below, all was still and silent. Even the hum of the transport chutes that carried Matoran from place to place was muted here. Nothing was allowed to disturb the work of the Matoran scholars who toiled in the crystal Knowledge Towers. There they pored over the written records of Metru Nui, deciphered ancient prophecies, and crafted predictions of the future. Once, Nuju had been one of them. Now it was up to him to make sure there would be tomorrows to ponder.</p>
			<p>At first, it seemed like that would be a simple enough task. The Ko-Metru Matoran who Vakama claimed had knowledge of the disk was named Ehrye. Finding him should not have been an issue. In fact, it was often impossible <i>not</i> to find Ehrye, even when you wanted to avoid him. He was constantly underfoot, running errands for different scholars and pleading for a chance to become one of them.</p>
			<p>Nuju, naturally, had said no. Working in a Knowledge Tower required wisdom, patience, and experience. All Ehrye had to offer were enthusiasm and too much energy for his own good. So the Matoran went back to running errands and dreaming of life inside the towers.</p>
			<p><i>And now, when I</i> want <i>to find him, he's disappeared!</i> fumed Nuju.</p>
			<p>A search of Ehrye's home had turned up a marked Ko-Metru chute station map and a disturbing journal entry. It read in part:</p>
			<p><i>I'm going to show them. If I turn over the Great Kanoka Disk like I said I would, I'll learn a secret that will make them beg me to join a Knowledge Tower!</i></p>
			<p>Nuju shook his head. He had spent his whole life studying what might be and what would be in the days to come, and he knew one thing for certain. There was no future in what Ehrye was about to do.</p>
			<p>The Toa of Ice leaped from the top of a Knowledge Tower, his eyes focused on the ledge of another. When he had maneuvered within arm's reach of it, he snapped a crystal spike from his back and swung it hard. It dug into the side of the tower. Nuju swung gracefully around the building, pulling the spike free as he did so. He repeated the exercise twice more on the way down, growing more used to his new Toa tools along the way. Someday, he knew, that experience might save his life.</p>
			<p>Nuju had taken the chute map with him when he left Ehrye's house. He hit the ground close to the station that was marked on the map. The attendant was deep in thought and did not notice his approach.</p>
			<p>"What? Oh!" he exclaimed when Nuju tapped his shoulder. "Who are you? What do you want?"</p>
			<p>"I am Nuju, Toa Metru of Ice. I am looking for a runner named Ehrye. Have you seen him?"</p>
			<p>The attendant frowned. "Yes, he was here. I saw him talking to a Matoran from another metru. I don't remember which. Then he jumped in a chute heading for one of the Knowledge Towers. He was muttering something about a disk."</p>
			<p>"Where did he have this conversation?"</p>
			<p>"Ummm...Let me see. I remember I was analyzing chute dynamics at the time and not really paying attention. But I think it was in that corner over there."</p>
			<p>Nuju turned away without saying thank you. He was in no mood to waste words. Instead, he walked over to where the attendant had directed him and looked around. There was little to be seen, just a Po-Metru carving tool and a pass to the Onu-Metru Archives. Either might be important, or they might have been dropped by any of hundreds of Matoran who passed through this chute station.</p>
			<p>The attendant had gone back to pondering. It was something Ko-Metru Matoran spent a lot of time doing, in hopes of one day securing a position in a Knowledge Tower. Unfortunately, it also made it hard to get their attention.</p>
			<p>"If you see Ehrye again, hold on to him," Toa Nuju said.</p>
			<p>"Hmmm? What? Hold on to whom?" the attendant asked, confused.</p>
			<p>Nuju walked away, wondering why he even bothered to talk to some Matoran.</p>
			<p>The chute Ehrye had taken led to the lower level of a Knowledge Tower. It was such a silent place it made the rest of the metru seem positively wild and loud. A small number of Ko-Matoran were hard at work, junior seers who hoped to one day ascend to the ranks of those who labored on the upper levels. Nuju had spent most of his life in Knowledge Towers and could not recall ever seeing a group of scholars looking so annoyed.</p>
			<p>As usual, trying to get a scholar to take a break from his studies to talk was like trying to teach kolhii rules to a Rahkshi. They did not seem at all impressed by the presence of a Toa Metru. It was only when Nuju mentioned that a Great Disk was involved that one of them agreed to talk.</p>
			<p>"A Great Disk, hmmm?" said the scholar. "Incredible power. I would love the chance to study one. Do you have it?"</p>
			<p>"No, I am seeking it. I believe a Matoran named Ehrye is as well, and he may have come here."</p>
			<p>"Ehrye!" the scholar spat. "So that was his name! He barged in asking a lot of questions about Kanoka disks, the Morbuzakh plant, and other things that were not his business. No, not his business at all! Then he took a chute to the top of the tower, which is forbidden!"</p>
			<p>The other Matoran had turned to see what all the shouting was about. The scholar spotted their angry looks and dropped his voice almost to a whisper. "You will find him there, but you must do something for us in exchange for this information."</p>
			<p>The scholar dug into his robes and pulled out a knowledge crystal a little larger than Nuju's hand. "The Morbuzakh vines have done great damage to our towers," the scholar explained. "With this crystal, a new tower can be grown. When you reach the top level, throw this into the air. Wherever it lands, a new tower shall appear."</p>
			<p>Nuju took the crystal. "A gift to the future of Metru Nui, then. I will do it."</p>
			<p>High atop the Knowledge Tower, the air was crisp and clean. One could always find a sense of peace and the time for contemplation here. What could not be found, at least today, was any sign of Ehrye.</p>
			<p>Toa Nuju felt the weight of the crystal in his hand. He approached the edge of the tower, took a deep breath, and tossed the crystal out into space. It tumbled through the air, vanishing into the mist below. An instant later, Nuju followed.</p>
			<p>As he fell, he let doubt creep into his mind again. What if Vakama was wrong? What if the Great Disks proved to no one that they were Toa? What if the Great Disks didn't exist at all but were just legends? What then?</p>
			<p>Nuju twisted his body in midair. He could barely see the outlines of the new tower. An instant later, he landed feetfirst on the top of the rapidly growing structure. It lifted him high in the air once more as it took its place among the other monuments to knowledge in Ko-Metru.</p>
			<p>From this new vantage point, Nuju scanned the metru. Off to the west, he spotted something that looked out of place. A Knowledge Tower's rooftop was littered with protodermis blocks. Since towers were grown, not built, there was no reason any construction material would be there.</p>
			<p>He was about to dismiss it as one more strange thing in a city that seemed to be filled with them when he spotted movement behind the blocks. It was Ehrye! Nuju had barely realized that when he saw something much more frightening-a huge crack traveling up the side of the tower. The whole structure was about to fragment and take the Matoran with it.</p>
			<p>Nuju got a running start and leaped off the tower. Using his crystal spikes, he swung from one chute to the next as fast as he could. When he was almost on top of the tower, he let go and dropped.</p>
			<p>For once, the Toa of Ice tried not to think about the future. If he pondered the possible consequences of what he was trying to do, he would never be able to do it. He waited until his fall had brought him almost parallel to the crack in the tower, then held out his twin spikes and focused his ice power through them. Thin streams of ice shot from the tools, welding the crack shut as he fell.</p>
			<p>Now came the hard part. Most of the damage was repaired, but if he could not stop his fall, he would be an ex-Toa Metru very quickly. He spun, twisted, and dug one spike into the side of the tower. It carved a gash in the crystal and he continued to fall, desperately trying to hang on to the Toa tool. Finally, with the ground much too close for comfort, the spike held and he came to an abrupt stop.</p>
			<p><i>No wonder we had to be chosen to be Toa Metru,</i> he thought as he began the long climb to the top of the tower. <i>No one would ever volunteer for this job.</i></p>
			<p>Ehrye was still where Nuju had last seen him: trapped behind protodermis blocks at the very top of the tower. Worse,the blocks had not been stacked haphazardly. They were arranged, almost like a puzzle, in such a way that moving the wrong one would bring them all crashing down on the Matoran.</p>
			<p>Nuju spent a long time staring at the blocks before he gently shifted one. Then he went back to analyzing the barricade. Ehrye, impatient, shoted, "Are you going to get me out of here? What are you doing?"</p>
			<p>"Quiet," Nuju replied. "Someone did not want you walking away from this tower. But you are important to the future of Metru Nui, fortunately for you, so the Toa of Ice is going to get you out of what you have gotten into."</p>
			<p>"Yes, I heard you were a Toa," said the Matoran grimly. "Now I'll never have a chance at a promotion."</p>
			<p>The Toa Metru ignored him. This puzzle was highly intricate, but it was designed to defeat someone who could not think ahead. <i>They picked the wrong Toa then,</i> Nuju said to himself.</p>
			<p>It took an agonizingly long time, but finally enough blocks were cleared for Ehrye to slip out. He stretched himself and looked up at his rescuer. "I suppose you're wondering how I got here?"</p>
			<p>"Yes. You took many risks, Ehrye, and broke a number of laws. I should turn you over to the Vahki and be done with it. But I need you. Or, rather, I need the Kanoka disk you have located."</p>
			<p>"Why should I give it to you?" Ehrye replied. "That disk could be my ticket to a Knowledge Tower position."</p>
			<p>Nuju gestured at the pile of protodermis blocks. "It was almost your ticket to a tomb. Think about the future, Ehrye."</p>
			<p>The Matoran spent a few minutes doing just that. Then he said, "I get full credit for finding it? And no Vahki come knocking on my door?"</p>
			<p>"Vahki don't knock," Nuju reminded him. "They smash doors down. And they keep smashing them down until they find the one you're hiding behind."</p>
			<p>"You have a point," Ehrye agreed. "Even if I didn't have to worry about them, there's still that big Rahi breath that walled me up here."</p>
			<p>Nuju and Ehrye headed for the chute that would bring them back down to ground level. Still shaken by his experience, Ehrye wouldn't stop babbling. "I know why you're looking for that disk, Toa Nuju. It's the root, right?"</p>
			<p>"Root?"</p>
			<p>"The Morbuzakh plant-it has a king root. I found that out when I was researching the Great Disk. Stop the root, you stop the spread of the plant. But you need all six disks to do it."</p>
			<p>"Then you will come with me to see the other Toa Metru now," Nuju said.</p>
			<p>"There are more of you?"</p>
			<p>"And then we will go get the Great Disk."</p>
			<p>"Oh, I'll tell you where it is. I'll even go with you. But you're going to have to retrieve it. From what I've learned, no one but a Toa Metru has a chance of getting that disk from its hiding place."</p>
			<p>"I see," Nuju said.</p>
			<p>"In fact," continued Ehrye, "I might not get the Knowledge Tower job. But if the Great Disk is as hard to get as I think it is, your job might be open soon, Toa of Ice."</p>
			<p>Neither one of them laughed at Ehrye's little joke.</p>
			<p>	*	*	*</p>
			<p>When they reached the ground, Nuju gestured for Ehrye to follow him. To the Matoran's surprise, they did not head for a chute station but for the alley behind the tower.</p>
			<p>"Where are we going?"</p>
			<p>"Knowledge Towers do not crack by themselves," said Nuju. "Well, sometimes they do, but this one did not. I am searching for the cause."</p>
			<p>Ehrye trailed along behind as Nuju walked up and down the length of the alley. Along the way, the Matoran peppered him with questions. "What are you looking for? Does that mean anything? What does it feel like to be a Toa Metru? Do you think the Morbuzakh plant will wreck the whole city?"</p>
			<p>"Enough!" Nuju snapped. "The future will bring the answers to your questions, but only if you stop speaking long enough to notice them."</p>
			<p>"That's what you always say," Ehrye grumbled.</p>
			<p>"When it stops being true, I will stop saying it," Nuju replied.</p>
			<p>The Toa of Ice moved around to a shadowed portion of the tower. There, just below eye level, was the beginning of the crack that had threatened to bring the whole structure down. Peering closely at it, he looked for any sign of the tool that had been used.</p>
			<p>What he found was something quite different. The edges of the damaged area were melted and fused. In many places,the crystal had turned black. No Matoran tool had done this. It was a surge of energy.</p>
			<p>Troubled, Nuju knelt down to examine the ground. Crushed knowledge crystals littered the pavement. The Toa of Ice carefully sifted through them to reveal scrapings on the ground below. They were the marks of a four-footed being who had stood right in that spot while he no doubt set his trap.</p>
			<p><i>Vakama was right,</i> Nuju thought. <i>This time. But who is this monster? Why is he doing this? Is he working for someone else, or does he stand to gain somehow by all this damage?</i></p>
			<p>He rose and walked toward the mouth of the alley, not saying a word to Ehrye. The Matoran kicked at the knowledge crystal fragments before following. His thoughts had gone back to the missed opportunity of the Great Disk. If he could have gotten his hands on it or maybe somehow tricked Nuju into getting it for him, Ko-Metru would have been at his feet. Now it would be back to running errands. Unless, of course, he could still find a way to get the disk after Nuju found it.</p>
			<p>Ehrye was still pondering that happy thought when Nuju stopped short. The Toa of Ice bent down to pick up an artifact, but Ehrye could not make out what it was. After a moment, Nuju turned around and held the item out. It was a small, intricate carving.</p>
			<p>"What's that?" Ehrye asked.</p>
			<p>"I thought perhaps you could tell me," said Nuju coldly. "This came from Po-Metru. It's signed by Ahkmou the carver."</p>
			<p>Ehrye shrugged. "So?"</p>
			<p>"At the chute station, the attendant said he saw you talking with a Matoran before you left for the Knowledge Tower. He couldn't remember who it was, but I think I know. It was Ahkmou, wasn't it? That's why there was a Po-Metru carving tool in the station. He was careless...must have been in a big hurry."</p>
			<p>"Okay, so it was Ahkmou," Ehrye replied. "We're friends. We play kolhii together sometimes. What does this have to do with-?"</p>
			<p>"Listen to me," Nuju said, leaning in so close that Ehrye was chilled by his frigid breath. "We are not playing kolhii now. All of Metru Nui is at stake. Now, what did Ahkmou want?"</p>
			<p>Ehrye broke and ran. Nuju frowned and used a minimal amount of elemental power to block the alley with a wall of ice. Stymied, the Matoran turned around.</p>
			<p>"Wrong answer," said Nuju.</p>
			<p>"All right. He said he wanted to carve replicas of the Great Disks as a gift for Turaga Dume. He wanted to know all about them and figured I could get information from the Knowledge Towers."</p>
			<p>"Is that all he said?"</p>
			<p>"Yes," Ehrye answered, his eyes on the ground.</p>
			<p>Nuju could tell he was not revealing the whole truth, but there would be time to uncover it later. For now, they needed to return to Ga-Metru and meet with the other Toa. He turned and walked toward the chute station, confident that Ehrye would be wise enough not to try to run again.</p>
			<p>"What are you going to do about that ice wall?" the Matoran asked. "Will it melt?"</p>
			<p>"Eventually."</p>
			<p>"Won't there be questions? I mean, how many Matoran know there's a Toa of Ice around?"</p>
			<p>"It will give the scholars something to ponder," said Nuju. "And before all is said and done, all of Metru Nui will know that Toa Nuju has arrived."</p>
			<h2>7</h2>
			<p>Matau, Toa Metru of Air, knew all about chutes. He had been riding the transparent, magnetized protodermis tubes from place to place all his life, as had most Matoran. Living in Le-Metru, transport hub for the entire city, he had even had the chance to repair a chute or three in his time. He was quite proud of the fact that no one outside of his metru knew more about chutes than he did.</p>
			<p>All of which made it even stranger that he was now hurtling out of control through a chute at a ridiculously high speed, heading for what would probably be a very dead end.</p>
			<p>Outside the chute, the green-and-brown structures of Le-Metru were nothing but a blur. Matau whipped around a corner, heading for a busy junction and hoping he was not about to collide with some poor Matoran. For at least the tenth time, he tried to jump through the walls of the chute and exit. But he was thrown back yet again, slamming into the opposite wall and then picking up speed again.</p>
			<p><i>I wanted to get there quick-fast, but not this quick-fast,</i> he thought. He wasn't sure how anyone could manage to seal off the walls of a chute, or whether this affected the entire metru system, or just the tube he was rocketing through.</p>
			<p><i>But I can take a smart-guess. Fire-spitter was right. These disks must be important, and someone doesn't want me to find mine.</i></p>
			<p>Matau's mind raced almost as fast as his body through the chute. The chutes ran throughout the city, but the densest concentration was in Le-Metru. They all fed into one another. If it was only this chute that had been tampered with, then it should be possible to steer into another at the junction.</p>
			<p>"Possible. Not healthy-safe, but possible," he muttered.</p>
			<p>First thing Matau had to do was slow down. He unhooked his twin aero slicers from his back and tried digging them into the walls of the chute to act as brakes. But whatever had made the chute resist exits also made it too tough for the slicers to pierce.</p>
			<p><i>I'm thought-planning like a Matoran still,</i> Matau told himself. <i>The tools aren't the power. I'm a Toa-hero. I'm the power!</i></p>
			<p>The Toa Metru of Air glanced ahead. The junction was rushing up toward him, and a transport cart was heading for it from a side chute. At the rate he was moving, he would slam right into the cart. But if he could use his power to slow just a little...</p>
			<p>Matau was not famous for deep thought and concentration, but he managed some now. He forced his will on the air in the chute, making it form a thick cushion to lower his speed. Little by little, he could feel himself slowing, but would it be enough?</p>
			<p>The transport cart shot through the junction. A split second later, Matau went through. Straining, he reached out and grabbed the back of the cart, letting it pull him down the side chute. The abrupt stop and change of direction almost ripped his arm out of the socket, but somehow he found the strength to hang on. It was only when he had traveled some way from his original chute that he let go and exited out the wall. Then he waited until the world around him stopped going in circles.</p>
			<p>Toa Matau found himself not far from his original destination: the Ussal crab pen of the Le-Matoran named Orkahm. He decided to skip a chute and instead take the sky route via the cables that hung everywhere in Le-Metru.</p>
			<p>Ussal pens could be found all over the metru. The carts they pulled transported goods too large or fragile for the chutes or carried Matoran who preferred to travel a little more slowly. The large crabs were specially trained to obey the commands of their riders, although they had been known to get temperamental at times. Even from high above, it was easy to locate an Ussal crab pen by the aroma-they were not the sweetest-smelling Rahi around.</p>
			<p>Matau dropped to the ground near one of the crab keepers. "Don't worry-fear! It's me, Matau. I am a Toa-hero now!"</p>
			<p>The keeper dropped his tools in surprise. "Wow! You've pulled some great jokes before, Matau, but this-this tops them all."</p>
			<p>"This isn't a joke," Matau insisted. "I was given this Toa stone, and I brought it to the Great Temple, and...There isn't time for this. I am looking to seek-find Orkahm. Have you seen him?"</p>
			<p>"No," the keeper said. "And I would just as soon he stays away. He's been acting crazy. Said he found something on his route-path, but wouldn't show it to anyone. He was going to bury-hide it. Orkahm always seemed like such a good rider. Who knew the pressure would get to him?"</p>
			<p>Matau nodded. It would take too long to explain the situation, but he knew Orkahm had not lost his mind. The Matoran had found a Great Disk and knew someone would try to take it away from him, maybe the same someone who had sabotaged the chute. "So he's gone?"</p>
			<p>"He is, but his cart's here. Why are you so interested, Matau? Planning a trick-joke on him?" the keeper said, laughing. "He already doesn't like you. I don't think you want to make it worse."</p>
			<p>Matau spotted Orkahm's cart, sitting alone off to the side of the pens. Each rider kept a logbook of his travels during the day, and Orkahm was no exception. Matau fished it out from under the seat and flipped it open, only to discover the careful rider had written the whole thing in code.</p>
			<p>Matau was tempted to give up. Then he reminded himself that the other Toa Metru had probably made contact with their Matoran and were waiting for him. Besides, finding Orkahm and the disk would prove to everyone in Le-Metru that he was a Toa-hero.</p>
			<p>He sat down on the cart and began studying the code. Matau had known Orkahm a long time. The Matoran was thorough, cautious, and meticulous, which made him a slow rider. Matau, on the other hand, had always been fast and reckless, which was why the two never got along. But the most important thing Matau remembered about Orkahm was that he had little imagination.</p>
			<p>Once the Toa realized that, breaking the code was simple. Orkahm had substituted numbers for letters, but it wasn't done in a particularly clever way. Deciphered, there were three entries, all dated the day before.</p>
			<p><i>Disk hidden.</i></p>
			<p><i>A. wants disk.</i></p>
			<p><i>Moto-hub sector 3.</i></p>
			<p><i>He's deephiding in sector 3,</i> Matau realized. <i>He's either a fool or very, very scared. Probably both.</i></p>
			<p>Matau jumped in a chute headed northeast. Sector 3 was just across one of the major protodermis canals from Ta-Metru. It had long been known for the sheer number of chute malfunctions that took place there. These were blamed on everything from poor construction to just bad luck, until repair crews sent to the area started disappearing. That was when rumors began to spread that the Morbuzakh was behind all the troubles. Since then, all repair crews traveled with Vahki escorts. Even with that, the Vahki usually returned alone. And since the security guards were incapable of speech, they couldn't explain what had happened.</p>
			<p><i>If Orkahm wanted a place to hide, he chose a dangerous one,</i> Matau thought. <i>Unless he thinks-knows something I don't?</i></p>
			<p>Matau leaped out of the chute at a station on the outskirts of the sector. The area had not been abandoned. There were still plenty of riders and other Matoran to be seen, hard at work. But everyone seemed to be moving very quickly and looking over their shoulders every few seconds. This part of Metru Nui wasn't ruled by Turaga Dume or the Vahki. It was ruled by fear.</p>
			<p>The sudden appearance of a Toa in their midst drew a lot of attention from the Le-Matoran. They crowded around, asking questions, admiring his armor, and saying that now they were sure everything would be all right. Matau was having such a good time he almost forgot why he was there.</p>
			<p>He was reminded abruptly when a transport manager came up to him and said, "Are you looking for Orkahm?"</p>
			<p>"Yes. How did you know?"</p>
			<p>"He came hurry-running through here a little while ago. He said someone might be following him, and if anyone asked, not to tell them where he had gone."</p>
			<p>"Then why are you telling me? Not that I am sad-complaining," said Matau.</p>
			<p>"Because you are a Toa," the transport manager replied. "I have seen Toa before, a long time ago, but never met one. I know the legends, though-how Toa are here to protect us and keep us safe. Whatever Orkahm is doing, I don't think he's safe right now. Do you?"</p>
			<p>Orkahm had made straight for a long-unused chute that went even deeper into sector 3. Matau was about to follow when he noticed something on the support struts beneath the chute. Something had been scratched into the solid protodermis.</p>
			<p>Matau knelt down to take a closer look. The carving was relatively fresh, made with a short, sharp instrument. It had left behind protodermis dust in the scratchings, but not dust from the strut. This looked more like dust from Po-Metru. Carved into the strut was a single word: <b>PEWKU</b>.</p>
			<p>Matau read it once more to make sure he wasn't mistaken. Under ordinary circumstances, he would have dismissed this as some Matoran's idea of fun, leaving a mark behind on a chute. Matau had done that sort of prank himself in the past, along with hundreds of others.</p>
			<p>But this was no joke-this was a message. Pewku was the name of Orkahm's favorite Ussal crab, the one he had been riding for as long as Matau could remember. The Toa doubted Orkahm would have taken the time to scratch this in the strut.</p>
			<p><i>Someone else, then,</i> he said to himself. <i>As a code-sign?</i></p>
			<p>Without hesitating even for a moment, Matau jumped into the chute and began to follow the trail of the missing Matoran.</p>
			<p>	*	*	*</p>
			<p>The farther one traveled into this portion of Le-Metru, the more the buildings, chutes, and cables seemed to crowd in. The residents were fighting a losing battle against the Morbuzakh here. It was obvious that even the Vahki were not venturing this far, because Matau spotted at least two nests of insectoid Nui-Rama on rooftops. Normally, they would have been netted and shipped off to the Archives long ago.</p>
			<p>Matau could see the chute change direction sharply up ahead. To his trained eye, it was obvious that the chute had not been built that way. Someone had rerouted it and not done a very good job. Still, the cylinder of energy held as he tore around the corner and went flying into the air.</p>
			<p><i>Of course. Badly fix-patched chute, cut-severed end, why am I surprised?</i></p>
			<p>He landed hard amid a tangled nest of transport cables. These cables helped feed energized protodermis into the chutes and chute stations, not to mention being great fun to swing from. Matau was puzzling over how he would ever untangle them when he noticed something in the center of the tangle, looking like it had been caught in a Fikou spiderweb.</p>
			<p>It was Orkahm!</p>
			<p>"Rider!" Matau said. "How did you get yourself in this trap-snare?"</p>
			<p>"I didn't! Someone put me here!" the Matoran replied. "Now, please get me out!"</p>
			<p>Matau worked as quickly as he could, unknotting the cables but being careful not to tighten them around Orkahm in the process. When he was done, the Matoran practically fell into his arms.</p>
			<p>"What happened?" Matau asked. "Where is the Great Disk?"</p>
			<p>"Not here. I wish it was! I wish I could give it away right now, with all the trouble it has caused me," Orkahm said, his voice filled with exhaustion. "Ever since I found it, I've been followed by two beings, one huge, one with four legs, not to mention having Ahkmou on my back about it. Then I got this message."</p>
			<p>He handed Matau a small tablet. It read:</p>
			<p><i>The disk you found is vital to the security of the city. Bring it to Moto-Hub sector 3 and take the marked chute.</i></p>
			<p>"But you didn't bring the disk," Matau said.</p>
			<p>"I thought it might be a trick. Maybe they wanted to follow me to where it was hidden. No sooner did I get here than these cables snapped tight around me. I heard a voice say that someone would be along soon to talk to me. But no one came until you, Matau."</p>
			<p>"You know who I am?" Matau said, surprised.</p>
			<p>"Of course! Only you would be foolish enough, reckless enough, to come after me here. You were a danger to everyone on the road as a rider, and you will probably be a danger as a Toa, too. But thank you."</p>
			<p>For the first time in his life, Matau found he had nothing to say. It was just as well, too, for if he had spoken he would have never heard the slithering sound coming from among the cables. He shot a look at the web only long enough to see three Morbuzakh vines working their way toward them.</p>
			<p>"We have to get out of here!" he shouted.</p>
			<p>Now Orkahm saw the vines, too, and was backing away. "How? The chute only goes in one direction, and it's too high up to jump to anyway. We're trapped!"</p>
			<p>"Toa-heroes are never trapped," Matau said, doing his best to sound the way he imagined a Toa Metru should. He grabbed Orkahm and yelled, "Hang on!" as the twin aero slicers on his back began to whirl.</p>
			<p>It wasn't easy getting off the ground with the extra weight of Orkahm, but they managed it with barely an inch to spare. The vines wrapped themselves around the chute struts and snaked their way after the two, but by now Matau was flying too high and too fast for them to catch.</p>
			<p>"How did you know this would work?" Orkahm asked.</p>
			<p>"I'm a Toa-hero. This is what we do," Matau answered. He decided it was best to keep to himself the fact that he'd had absolutely no idea whether the stunt would work and just took the chance.</p>
			<p><i>Maybe that is what being a Toa-hero is really about in the end,</i> he thought as he flew over Le-Metru. <i>Taking the chances you have to take. Doing the things no one else is able to do.</i></p>
			<p>Matau banked sharply and headed for the center of the metru. <i>I think I could get to like this,</i> he said to himself with a smile.</p>
			<h2>8</h2>
			<p>Onewa, Toa of Stone, ran at full speed through the Sculpture Fields of Po-Metru. Unfortunately, full speed was not all that fast. His new body was built for strength, not sprinting.</p>
			<p>"I need a Mask of Speed," he muttered to himself. "If a Toa of Stone has to do this sort of thing, he needs whatever help he can get."</p>
			<p>He pushed the thought of masks out of his mind. He had no idea what Mask of Power he was wearing, what it might do, or even how to make it work. He hoped that eventually that would change, but for now there was no point in worrying about it. Onewa had a mission to perform, so, legs aching and heartlight flashing rapidly, he kept running.</p>
			<p>The Sculpture Fields were home to hundreds of statues, most of them far too big to fit in even the largest Po-Metru warehouse. Onewa's goal was one particular work of art, with a very unique feature: a Matoran named Ahkmou was sitting on top of it.</p>
			<p>"Hey, Onewa," the Matoran shouted. "What gets harder to catch the faster you run?"</p>
			<p>Onewa glared at him. "My breath! You can do better than that, Ahkmou."</p>
			<p>"Well, hurry up and get me down from here!" the Matoran replied. "You can, can't you?"</p>
			<p>"Just stay there. I'll get to you."</p>
			<p>As he ran, the Toa of Stone thought back to how he had ended up here. His first stop had been Ahkmou's home, but the Matoran wasn't there. Carvings were scattered all over the floor, furniture was thrown about. Onewa worried that Ahkmou had been kidnapped.</p>
			<p>A visit to his workplace had turned up no sign of him either. The other carvers said that their coworker had been jumpy lately, especially after he got a visit from two strangers. One had four legs, the other was a giant, and neither looked like he was bringing good news.</p>
			<p>Onewa frowned. The description sounded a lot like the hunter Vakama claimed to have seen, although there was no telling who the brute with him might be. Still puzzling over that, he opened Ahkmou's carver desk. Inside, it was a jumble of items. Onewa spotted not only Po-Metru carving tools but equipment from Ta-Metru, maps from Le-Metru, and assorted items from other parts of the city. It wasn't illegal to have any of that, of course, but why would a Po-Metru carver need it?</p>
			<p><i>Then again, maybe it all means nothing,</i> Onewa thought. <i>The two strangers could have been some new kind of Vahki that Turaga Dume has put in service. The items in his station could be souvenirs of some kind. I mean, what are the chances Ahkmou has a Great Disk and hasn't told everyone he knows about it already? I don't think Vakama had a "vision". I think he was just seeing things.</i></p>
			<p>There were still questions to answer, though. Onewa had stumbled on a hidden map of the Sculpture Fields on his way here. One spot was marked, and it was the very same spot at which Ahkmou was waiting now. Who wanted him to go there? And why?</p>
			<p>Onewa reached the base of the statue. It was a very long way to the top. Taking a deep breath, he dug his two new tools, called proto pitons, into the stone and began to climb.</p>
			<p>Ahkmou leaned over the side and watched. Then he said, "So how did you do it? Really?"</p>
			<p>"How did I do what?"</p>
			<p>"Make yourself look like a Toa."</p>
			<p>"I don't just look like a Toa," Onewa snapped. "I am a Toa!"</p>
			<p>"Oh," Ahkmou said, so quietly Onewa could barely hear him. "I see. You must be one of the six, then. And you were looking for me? Is that why you came out here?"</p>
			<p>Onewa dragged himself a little farther up the side of the statue. "Yes. I came out here because a fire spitter has been standing too close to his forge and told me I should. He said you had a Great Kanoka Disk."</p>
			<p>Ahkmou shook his head. "I don't know anything about any disk. I'm a carver."</p>
			<p>With one last effort, Onewa pulled himself to the top of the statue. He lay there, panting for a moment, before looking up at the Matoran. "So how did you get up here?"</p>
			<p>Ahkmou stood up and backed away a few steps. Suddenly, he seemed nervous. "I-um-I just came up to..." The Matoran's eyes went wide. "Nidhiki!"</p>
			<p>Onewa turned around just in time to catch a fleeting glimpse of a four-legged creature on the field below, vanishing behind a statue.</p>
			<p>"Who is-" he began, looking back at Ahkmou. But the Matoran was gone. Onewa leaned over the side and saw Ahkmou climbing swiftly down on a series of spikes wedged into the statue.</p>
			<p>"Hey! Come back here!" the Toa shouted, but Ahkmou was already leaping from statue to statue, heading for the exit from the field.</p>
			<p>Onewa gave a growl of frustration and started after him. He had just begun to climb down when he noticed something carved into the top of the statue. It read <b>PO-METRU CHUTE 445</b>.</p>
			<p><i>All right then, Ahkmou,</i> the Toa of Stone said to himself. <i>I may not be as fast as you, but now I know where you're going.</i></p>
			<p>Getting out of the Sculpture Fields would be a great deal harder than getting into them had been, that much Onewa was sure of. The ground between his location and the exit was unstable, thanks to years of tilling the soil to recycle protodermis. Half the statues were sinking, and the other half had already disappeared in the marshy ground. Normally, only hopping from one sculpture to another would make for a safe exit.</p>
			<p>Onewa paused halfway down the makeshift ladder and began whirling his proto piton. "Toa don't hop," he said. "Not when they can do this."</p>
			<p>As smoothly as if he had been doing it for years, Onewa slung the piton toward another statue. The edge of the sharp tool caught the stone and held. After testing it with a few tugs, Onewa stepped off the climbing spikes and swung through the air.</p>
			<p>He looped in a wide arc around the sculpture, even as he readied his other piton. At the apex of his swing, he tossed the second piton and watched it bite into another sculpture. "Yes!" he bellowed, smiling. "Who needs chutes? This is the way a Toa should travel!"</p>
			<p>Ahkmou elbowed his way through the crowd at Chute Station 445. This was the busiest station in all of Po-Metru, linking as it did to all the other districts. Getting through it was a nightmare. Ahkmou knew that was most likely the reason he had been directed here. In this mob, anything could happen, and no one would ever notice.</p>
			<p><i>Well, this is one Matoran who doesn't intend to mysteriously disappear,</i> he thought. <i>I'm catching the next chute, and then let them try and find me.</i></p>
			<p>Ahkmou felt only one twinge of regret as he headed for the chute to Ta-Metru. He had hoped to somehow get his hands on the Po-Metru Great Disk before he left. But when Toa Onewa showed up, running suddenly seemed like a better idea.</p>
			<p>"At least I lost that big kolhii-head," he grumbled. Then he cast a quick glance back to make sure Onewa hadn't followed him. "Why anyone would make him a Toa, I can't-"</p>
			<p>Still searching the crowd for Onewa, Ahkmou slammed right into a pair of pillars and fell over. He sat up, brushed himself off, and was about to snarl something about idiots putting pillars in the middle of a chute station when he noticed something very disturbing.</p>
			<p>They weren't pillars. They were legs.</p>
			<p>Toa Metru legs.</p>
			<p>Ahkmou looked up into the smiling face of Onewa. "Going somewhere?" the Toa asked.</p>
			<p>"Just-just back to work," Ahkmou stammered. "Can't, um, spend all day sitting on statues, you know."</p>
			<p>"That's funny," Onewa replied, gesturing to the nearby chute. "I didn't know they had moved your carver's table to Ta-Metru."</p>
			<p>The Toa reached down and gently grabbed Ahkmou, lifting him into the air. "Why don't we try this again? Hello, Ahkmou. Where are you going? Why did someone leave a note for you on top of a sculpture? And where is the Great Disk?"</p>
			<p>"I don't know what you're talking about! Put me down!" Ahkmou shouted.</p>
			<p>Onewa noticed a Vahki responding to the disturbance. The crowd parted to let the security enforcer through. He considered just bolting with the Matoran, but sudden movement would be sure to provoke a pursuit, and there wasn't time for that.</p>
			<p>For his part, Ahkmou had not even noticed the Vahki. His attention was riveted by the sudden appearance of Nidhiki, who was watching the action from a shadowy corner of the station with a sinister grin on his face. The Matoran frantically weighed the choice between an angry Toa or a smiling, four-legged hunter and found it wasn't any choice at all.</p>
			<p>"Okay, tell you what," Ahkmou said quickly. "I'll help you find the Great Disk, but we have to go now. Understand? Now!"</p>
			<p>Onewa glanced at the Vahki, who was still a short distance away. When he looked over his shoulder to make sure the other direction was clear, he spotted Nidhiki withdrawing into the shadows. The Toa's eyes narrowed at the sight of him.</p>
			<p>"Sure, Ahkmou," Onewa said quietly. "I think I do understand."</p>
			<p>"One of them is lying."</p>
			<p>Vakama's words were hard, but his tone was very soft. The Toa were sitting in the shadow of the Great Temple, sharing the tales of their adventures. When the stories were finished, it didn't take a vision to know something was very wrong.</p>
			<p>"What's that you're whisper-saying, fire-spitter?" asked Matau.</p>
			<p>Vakama glanced at the six Matoran, who were standing off to the side and looking uncomfortable. "It's just-look at what happened. We went out looking for six Matoran, and each of them was gone. They were lured away and promised whatever they wanted most in return for a Great Disk. Meanwhile, we ran into 'accidents' and sabotage every step of the way. Someone didn't want us to find them."</p>
			<p>"And you think one of the Matoran betrayed the others?" asked Nuju. "What about that four-legged monster and his friend? Couldn't they be behind this?"</p>
			<p>Vakama hesitated. Nokama leaned over and said, "Go ahead, Vakama. Tell us."</p>
			<p>"I've seen the four-legged one before," Vakama said quietly. "His power and his rage were...frightening. I don't think he would bother with such elaborate methods to lure the Matoran. He would have just taken them."</p>
			<p>"But which one can it be?" Nokama asked. "They all knew where to find a Great Disk. They all had reasons to dislike one of us. If anything, we have too many clues: notes from Ahkmou to Vhisola, notes from Vhisola to Tehutti, Ta-Metru tools, Le-Metru chute maps. Where do we start?"</p>
			<p>"You are looking at what they have in common, Nokama," said Whenua. "When an archivist is trying to solve a mystery of the past, he looks for what is uncommon, out of place. What is different about one of them?"</p>
			<p>Nuju frowned. "Old methods won't solve this, historian."</p>
			<p>"No, Whenua has a point," said Nokama. "For example, each of the Matoran recognized us as Toa Metru. Someone must have told them we have transformed. But none of them ever referred to six Toa, did they? Each Matoran only seemed to know about the Toa from his or her own metru. So maybe-"</p>
			<p>"You're wrong," cut in Onewa. "I didn't mention it before. I didn't think it was important. But when I talked to Ahkmou on top of the sculpture, he said something odd. He said, 'You must be one of the six'. And he seemed to know our four-legged friend. He called him by name-Nidhiki."</p>
			<p>All eyes went to the Po-Matoran, who was standing apart from the others. "From what you said, Onewa, Ahkmou was the only one who lied about knowing the location of a Great Disk," said Nuju. "All the others practically bragged about it."</p>
			<p>"Ahkmou's name was on the note to Vhisola," said Nokama.</p>
			<p>"There was protodermis dust from Po-Metru near the sabotaged vat controls," said Vakama.</p>
			<p>"Ahkmou was asking Ehrye about the Great Disks," added Nuju.</p>
			<p>"Orkahm said Ahkmou need-wanted his disk very badly," said Matau.</p>
			<p>"And Ahkmou knew about Nui-Jaga, enough to use the idea of one to lure Tehutti into the Archives," finished Whenua.</p>
			<p>There was a long, uncomfortable silence, finally broken by Nokama. "Do you think...? Why would he do that?"</p>
			<p>"I say we ask him," said Onewa, rising. "And then we haul him to the Vahki."</p>
			<p>"No!" snapped Vakama. "We mustn't!"</p>
			<p>"Fire-spitter, I am getting tired of you giving orders," Onewa growled, taking a step toward the Toa of Fire. "Who made you leader? Maybe it's time we found out just which is more powerful, fire or stone!"</p>
			<p>Nokama stood and place herself between them. "Stop it! Metru Nui is in danger. This is no time to fight among ourselves!"</p>
			<p>"If you had something besides rocks in your head, carver, you would understand," said Whenua. "Even if Ahkmou is the traitor, he is still the only one who knows where the Po-Metru disk is hidden. We need him. But if you feel like you can't keep an eye on him, well, I-"</p>
			<p>"Listen, you dusty librarian, I found him and I can keep him in line!" snapped Onewa. "At least until I have the Great Disk in my hands."</p>
			<p>"Our job has just begun," said Nokama. "If Ahkmou has betrayed Metru Nui, he is a danger to us all, and so is that Nidhiki. Maybe they are working together, or maybe not, but we must beware of both."</p>
			<p>"Or maybe they need to beware of us," answered Onewa.</p>
			<p>"Nokama is right," said Vakama. "We have to find the Great Disks before it's too late. And we have to keep an eye on all the Matoran while we're doing it. The Morbuzakh is not our only enemy."</p>
			<p>Their conversation was interrupted by the ugly sound of a protodermis structure snapping in two. They turned to see Morbuzakh vines hauling the broken remains of a small Ga-Metru temple into the sea.</p>
			<p>"As if we need more than one, with that thing around," said Onewa. "Let's go. We have disks to find and a really nasty weed to rip out by the roots."</p>
			<h2>Epilogue</h2>
			<p>Turaga Vakama paused. The memories of his days as a Toa Metru were powerful ones. There were many times he thought he might never get the chance to tell the tales of Metru Nui and the struggle to save it. Now the words spilled from him like a flood, and he found it almost too much to bear. Toa Lhikan...the forges of Ta-Metru...his life as a Toa...all so long ago.</p>
			<p>"That can't be the end of the story," said Takanuva, Toa of Light. "I mean, there is more, isn't there?"</p>
			<p>Turaga Vakama smiled. "You were the Chronicler before you were a Toa, Takanuva, and that questioning spirit still lives on in you. Always you seek to know what is hidden. But you are right, that is only the beginning of my tale."</p>
			<p>"Did you find the Great Disks?" asked Tahu Nuva. "Did you defeat the Morbuzakh? We must know!"</p>
			<p>"And so you shall," said Vakama. "But I am weary, and there is much work still to be done. I will continue my tale tomorrow. Before I am done, you will know why we fought so hard for Metru Nui-and why we were forced to leave. Mata Nui, in his wisdom, brought us to this beautiful island that bears his name. But home will always be Metru Nui."</p>
			<p>"Very well, then," said Gali, Toa Nuva of Water. "We will leave you for now, wise one. I know I feel the need for a long talk with Turaga Nokama, and I am sure my brothers have similar ideas."</p>
			<p>"Indeed," answered Kopaka, Toa Nuva of Ice, quietly. "There have been far too many secrets kept on this island."</p>
			<p>The Toa Nuva filed away, heading in different directions. Only Takanuva remained behind with the Turaga of Fire.</p>
			<p>"What troubles you, Toa?" asked Vakama. "Was my tale not what you expected?"</p>
			<p>"It's not that," said Takanuva. "I have been a Matoran and now I am a Toa, and yet I still do not remember this city of Metru Nui! Why?"</p>
			<p>"You will learn all, in time. Perhaps we should have shared all of this with you long ago, but we felt it would be cruel to remind you of a home you might never see again."</p>
			<p>Takanuva nodded. "Perhaps that was wise, Turaga. But tell me, when you lived in Metru Nui-was it wonderful?"</p>
			<p>"Wonderful...and terrible," said the Turaga. "I fear that when I have finished my tale, the Toa will have learned the true meaning of darkness."</p>

			<h1>BIONICLE Adventures #2: Trial by Fire</h1>
			<h3>Greg Farshtey</h3>
			<h2>Prologue</h2>
			<p>Tahu Nuva, Toa of Fire, struggled to accept all that he had heard. Many a time he had listened to Turaga Vakama, elder of the village of Ta-Koro, tell a tale of past glories. But never such a story as this.</p>
			<p>He had asked the Turaga to share with him and his fellow heroes a tale of Metru Nui. The Toa would soon be leading the Matoran villagers to this new island. They wished to be prepared for any danger that might await them there.</p>
			<p>The tale Vakama told was a shocking one. He revealed that he and the other village elders had long, long ago, been Matoran, living in a great city on Metru Nui. Through a strange twist of fate, they were gifted with the power of Toa. Their destiny: to save their city from disaster.</p>
			<p>"We believe Metru Nui to be a paradise," Vakama had said. "But it was a city under siege. A dark, twisted plant called the Morbuzakh threatened from every side, bringing down buildings and driving Matoran from their homes. If left unchecked, nothing would remain of the city we loved."</p>
			<p>But how to save the city? The answer came to Vakama in a vision. The Toa Metru had to seek out six Matoran who knew the hiding places of the Great Disks. These disks, when used together, could defeat the Morbuzakh. It seemed a simple task, and one that would surely prove to all in Metru Nui that these new Toa were worthy of being called heroes.</p>
			<p>But the six Toa faced many dangers before the Matoran could be found. Still unskilled in the use of their powers, they barely escaped traps that had been set along the way. It soon became clear that one of the Matoran was seeking to betray the others, and all of Metru Nui as well.</p>
			<p>It was at that point that Vakama had stopped speaking. Now the Toa had gathered again to hear more of his strange tale.</p>
			<p>Gali Nuva, Toa of Water, approached him quietly and laid a hand on his shoulder.</p>
			<p>"Are you ready to continue, Turaga?" she asked. "Should we wait for another time?"</p>
			<p>Vakama shook his head. "No, Toa Gali. These secrets have been kept from you for far too long. The time has come to speak. But...it is not easy."</p>
			<p>"You said that you felt sure one of the six Matoran was walking in shadow," Tahu, Toa of Fire, said. "Why didn't you turn him over to the enforcers of order in Metru Nui-what did you call them?"</p>
			<p>"Vahki," replied Vakama. "We had no choice. Those six Matoran were the only ones who knew the location of the Great Disks, and we had to have those disks. But we knew we must take precautions against betrayal."</p>
			<p>"Tell us more, Turaga," said Pohatu. "Continue your story, please."</p>
			<p>"Very well, Toa of Stone," said Vakama. "Now where was I? Oh, yes. With the six Matoran having been found, we Toa Metru were ready to begin searching for the Great Disks. Time was running out-with each day, the Morbuzakh grew bolder and more of the city was brought to ruin."</p>
			<p>"It was decided that we would split into teams to search the city for the disks, bringing the Matoran with us. Of course, not everyone was happy about this idea..."</p>
			<h2>1</h2>
			<p>"Next time, I'm picking the teams," grumbled Onewa, Toa Metru of Stone. He had been trudging along behind Vakama, Toa of Fire, and two of the Matoran for the better part of an hour. He had't bothered to keep his unhappiness a secret.</p>
			<p>Nuhrii said nothing. A Matoran from the Ta-Metru district, all his energies were focused on finding the disks. In his mind, he saw himself showered with praise for helping to save the city and maybe even having a Mask of Power named after him someday. Turaga Dume, elder of Metru Nui, might even want a Matoran of such courage as an advisor.</p>
			<p>The other Matoran on the journey, Ahkmou, was a Po-Matoran carver. He turned back to look at Onewa and said, "Since when did Onewa follow the rules? Has becoming a Toa Metru made you soft? Leave these two fire-spitters behind and let's find the Great Disk ourselves."</p>
			<p>"Sure," grunted Onewa. "And maybe walk into another trap. Don't think I've forgotten how hard it was to catch you, Ahkmou. I trust you about as far as I could throw the Great Temple."</p>
			<p>Vakama was tempted to tell the bickering Po-Metru natives to be quiet, but that would probably just make things worse. Maybe it had been a mistake using Kanoka disks to choose the teams. But they were easy to find, since every Matoran used disks for sport, and the three-digit codes on them offered a simple way to decide. The two lowest codes worked together, the two highest, and so on. It was just bad luck he had wound up with Onewa. They just could not seem to get along.</p>
			<p>They had crossed the border of Ta-Metru a short while ago. Nokama, Toa Metru of Water, had found a series of clues to the locations of the Great Disks carved on the wall of the Great Temple. According to the inscription, finding the Ta-Metru disk required "embracing the root of fire". Vakama and Nuhrii both knew what that meant, but neither wanted to speak about it out loud.</p>
			<p>Onewa and Ahkmou looked around, uncomfortably. Their home metru was known for its wide, flat expanses where massive sculptures were carved and stored. Ta-Metru, on the other hand, was a land of fire, where molten rivers of protodermis were forged into masks, tools, and other objects. Buildings crowded in close and all of them reflected the red glow of the furnaces. The sound of crafters' tools striking in unison and the hiss of cooling masks seemed to come from every side.</p>
			<p>"I need a rest," said Ahkmou. "My feet are tired."</p>
			<p>"Mine too," said Nuhrii. "Why couldn't we just take the transport chutes?"</p>
			<p>Vakama frowned. He had insisted that they travel on foot, and Onewa had agreed. Taking the chutes would make it too easy for one or both Matoran to jump out midway and disappear into the streets and alleyways. "All right. But stay together and stay here."</p>
			<p>The two Matoran sat down. Vakama walked away, expecting Onewa to keep an eye on them, but the Toa Metru of Stone followed him. "Do you know where we're going? What is this 'root of fire'?"</p>
			<p>Vakama gestured toward the buildings that surrounded them. "Well, you know about the Great Furnace in Ta-Metru, and all the smaller furnaces and forges here. The flames that feed them come from fire pits...the 'roots' of the fire. They are highly dangerous places."</p>
			<p>"Let me guess. Climbing down into one is against the law in Ta-Metru, so we're going to have Vahki squads to worry about."</p>
			<p>"Probably."</p>
			<p>"You had better be right about all this," Onewa said. "Or it's the last time I'm trusting you, fire-spitter."</p>
			<p>Vakama felt anger rising in him, and this time didn't try to fight it off. "Do you have a better plan? These six disks are the only thing that can save Metru Nui. Unless we find them, the whole place is going to fall to the-Morbuzakh!"</p>
			<p>The Toa Metru of Fire pointed over Onewa's shoulder, but his warning came too late. A twisted Morbuzakh vine snaked out of a chute and wrapped itself around Onewa, lifting the startled Toa into the air.</p>
			<p>"My arms are pinned!" the Toa Metru of Stone shouted. "I can't get free!"</p>
			<p>"Hang on! I'll save you!" Vakama said, thrusting a disk into his disk launcher.</p>
			<p>"Hang on? Hang on to what??" The Morbuzakh was dragging Onewa toward the chute. Once inside, it would be too late to free him.</p>
			<p>Vakama aimed carefully and launched his disk at the vine. When it struck, it sent bitter cold along the length of the plant, freezing it solid. With the pressure gone, Onewa was able to wriggle free. He hit the ground and looked from the vine to Vakama.</p>
			<p>"Yeah, well," he muttered. "I could have done that myself...somehow." He idly swung his fist and shattered the frozen plant into a thousand icy shards.</p>
			<p>Vakama turned and headed back toward where the Matoran waited. "You can have the next one then. Maybe if you grumble at it, it will go away."</p>
			<p>"Hasn't worked with you," replied Onewa.</p>
			<p>Vakama didn't answer. The spot where they had left Nuhrii and Ahkmou was empty. He felt a sinking feeling inside. If the two of them had vanished...</p>
			<p>"There!" yelled Onewa. He pointed toward the two Matoran, who were fleeing in the direction of Po-Metru. The Toa of Stone whirled his proto-piton tool above his head and made a perfect throw, the cable wrapping around Ahkmou's legs. Smiling, Onewa began reeling in the Po-Matoran.</p>
			<p>"Nice," said Vakama. "But here's an easier way." He took out a teleportation disk, checked its three-digit code to make sure it was low power, and then hurled it from his launcher. It struck Nuhrii a glancing blow and the Ta-Matoran disappeared. An instant later, he popped back into existence right in front of the two Toa.</p>
			<p>"I guess you weren't that tired after all," said Vakama. "So let's keep moving."</p>
			<p>"So have you ever visited these fire pits before?" Onewa asked.</p>
			<p>"No," Vakama said softly. "Even mask makers are not allowed near them. The risk is too great."</p>
			<p>"Scorched Matoran, right?"</p>
			<p>"Not only that," said Vakama. "If anything happened to the flames in those pits, production in Ta-Metru would come to a halt." Seeing the lack of reaction on Onewa's face, he added, "There would be nothing for the Po-Matoran to carve."</p>
			<p>They were working their way slowly toward the center of the city, trying to keep off the busier avenues. Onewa insisted the two Matoran stay close, while he himself kept scanning the alleys. Vakama did not need to ask why. They both could sense they were being followed.</p>
			<p>At one point, just after they rounded a corner, Onewa gestured for them to flatten against the wall. They waited for a long moment, but no one went by except the occasional Matoran. Finally, Onewa peered around the edge of the building and shook his head. "Not there."</p>
			<p>"Who do you think it is?" asked Ahkmou.</p>
			<p>"Guess," answered Onewa. A four-legged creature named Nidhiki had been chasing Ahkmou when Onewa found him. The same powerful being had been responsible for sabotage and traps encountered by the other Toa Metru in their search for the Matoran. Whoever he was, he did not want the Toa finding the Great Disks.</p>
			<p>"Maybe we should get off the street," Vakama suggested. "We can take a shortcut through-"</p>
			<p>"The protodermis reclamation furnace," Nuhrii finished. "The rear exit would bring us out near the fire pits."</p>
			<p>"Lead the way," said Onewa. "All these fires, flames, and furnaces look alike to me."</p>
			<p>	*	*	*</p>
			<p>The protodermis reclamation furnace was relatively small as Ta-Metru furnaces went, but its fires were just as hot and had plenty to burn. Damaged masks, tools, and other items were sent here from the reclamation yard to be melted down. The resulting liquid protodermis was then fed through special channels back to the forges, where it could be used again. What went into the furnace was little more than garbage, but what came out might become something wonderful in the hands of a skilled crafter.</p>
			<p>Its function made it ideal for use as a shortcut to the fire pits. For one thing, the place ran itself. Few, if any, Matoran actually worked there, so the building would most likely be empty. The Nuurakh, the Ta-Metru Vahki squads, did not bother patrolling in the area. After all, who would want to steal trash?</p>
			<p>Vakama led the way as they slipped into the side entrance. The only light inside came from the fire in the furnace. The building consisted of a wide catwalk that ran along all four sides and looked down upon a long chute. The chute ran through the center of the building, carrying items directly from the yards to the flames. The air inside was heavy with smoke and the smell of melting protodermis.</p>
			<p>Onewa walked to the edge of the catwalk and peered down. He had never seen anything like this. In his home district of Po-Metru, goods arrived already shaped, and carvers added the finishing touches. Watching masks and tools move slowly through a chute toward destruction was incredible, and even a little frightening.</p>
			<p>Vakama joined him. "Sometimes I am not sure I like this place."</p>
			<p>"Why not?"</p>
			<p>"It keeps us from learning from our mistakes. We just melt them down and make them go away."</p>
			<p>"Toa! Watch out!"</p>
			<p>Neither Vakama nor Onewa had time to react to Nuhrii's shout. Twin blasts of energy struck them, sending them tumbling over the catwalk and through the energized walls of the chute. They hit hard and lay there, stunned, as the chute moved them closer and closer to the white-hot flames.</p>
			<p>Nidhiki stepped out of the shadows. The two Matoran had run away, but there would be time to find them later. For now, he wanted to enjoy his victory over the two Toa Metru. He looked down at the unmoving forms of Vakama and Onewa, his dark laughter mingling with the crackling of the flames.</p>
			<h2>2</h2>
			<p>Nuju, Toa Metru of Ice, and Whenua, Toa Metru of Earth, moved slowly and quietly down a darkened corridor. All around them, eyes frozen in suspended animation seemed to watch their progress. The most fearsome creatures ever to appear in Metru Nui were preserved here in the Onu-Metru Archives, still-living exhibits to be studied by Matoran scholars.</p>
			<p>Toa Nuju scowled as they walked through the latest in a series of seemingly endless hallways, filled with dusty display cases. Before he became a Toa, Nuju's job had been scanning the skies searching for hints of what the future held for Metru Nui. To him, the Archives were nothing but a monument to a dead past.</p>
			<p>"I never knew this place was so big," he muttered.</p>
			<p>"As big as it needs to be," replied Whenua, with pride in his voice. "We've added two new sub-levels lately. The subterranean sections will someday stretch to the sea in every direction!"</p>
			<p>"Why stop there? Why not just knock down the rest of the metru and turn the whole city into a dusty museum?"</p>
			<p>Whenua glanced at Nuju with an expression of irritation. "That might be better than wasting time and space trying to predict tomorrows that might not come."</p>
			<p>Nuju shook his head. They had been having some version of this argument since they left Ga-Metru on their search for the Great Disks. Neither one was going to change the other's mind, so there was no future in continuing. "Let's say we both live in the present for a moment. Do you think it was wise to leave Tehutti and Ehrye up above? What if they run off?"</p>
			<p>"We left them in a section of the Archives that Tehutti had never visited before. Even the best Matoran archivist would get lost trying to find his way out of an unfamiliar wing, and he knows it. Oh, look at that! We found that insectoid arm digging sub-level 6. It's not Bohrok, but we're not sure what else it might have belonged to."</p>
			<p>Nuju smiled. It was probably too much to ask to expect Whenua to stop giving tours. Even in the face of danger-the city threatened by the Morbuzakh plant, a handful of Matoran holding the key to its defeat-Whenua was still an old archivist at heart.</p>
			<p>The carving at the Great Temple had advised that "no door must be left unopened" in Onu-Metru if the Great Disk were to be found. But the Archives contained hundreds of thousands of doors, if not more. Fortunately, Tehutti knew which level concealed the disk. Now the trick was finding it.</p>
			<p>The two Toa Metru turned a corner. Before them, the hallway stretched as far as the eye could see. Each side was lined with doors easily four times the height of a Toa. The doors were thick and strong, too, and locked tight.</p>
			<p>"Why all the locks?" Nuju asked. "Worried someone will break into the exhibits?"</p>
			<p>Whenua chuckled. "No, Nuju. Worried that the exhibits will break <i>out</i>. Some of these creatures seem able to resist our efforts to put them in stasis."</p>
			<p>The Toa Metru of Earth stopped at the first door on the left. No sign gave a hint of what lay behind it, but that wasn't unusual. One of the rules of the Archives was, "If you have to ask what's behind the door, you aren't meant to open it."</p>
			<p>Nuju craned his neck to see the top of the massive door, then examined the equally oversized lock. "I don't suppose you have a key?"</p>
			<p>"No. Only the Chief Archivist has keys to this level. If he knew we were rummaging around down here, the Vahki would already be on their way."</p>
			<p>Nuju raised his crystal spike and fired a blast of ice at the lock, freezing it solid. "Then we make our own."</p>
			<p>Whenua nodded and revved up one of his earthshock drills. It took only a brief touch to shatter the frozen lock.</p>
			<p>The door slowly swung open. Nuju peered inside. "Whenua? There is something in there. Much too big to be a Great Disk."</p>
			<p>Before either of them could move, a gigantic Ussal crab claw shot from inside the room and clamped itself around the Toa. "Unngh! Wrong room! Wrong room!" Whenua shouted.</p>
			<p>"I figured that out for myself," Nuju replied, straining against the mighty claw to no effect. He was secretly grateful that it was impossible to see the Ussal to which the claw belonged. This day had already had enough nasty surprises.</p>
			<p>"This-owww!-is a very rare creature!" Whenua said. "Try not to hurt it!"</p>
			<p>Nuju pitted every bit of his strength against the claw and didn't so much as loosen its grip. "We are rare creatures, too, Whenua. Right now, I would even say endangered!"</p>
			<p>Whenua activated both of his earthshock drills, setting them spinning at a high rate of speed. "I think I have an idea, but it might bring the whole place down on us."</p>
			<p>"Let me worry about the future," Nuju replied. "It's what I do best."</p>
			<p>Whenua closed his eyes and concentrated on his Toa tools. The earthshock drills could bore through virtually any substance, even at low speed. But they had one other feature: when in use, they produced a loud hum.</p>
			<p><i>If I can get them going fast enough,</i> he thought. <i>Hit just the right frequency, maybe...</i></p>
			<p>The drills became a blur, whirling faster and faster. The hum went from painfully loud into the ultrasonic range. Whenua and Nuju both felt certain their heads would split open. Cracks began forming in the walls and ceiling. Whenua pushed as hard as he could to increase the speed, then pushed a little harder, doing his best not to scream from the strain.</p>
			<p>Suddenly, they were free. Both Toa dropped to the ground as the monstrous claw retreated back into the darkness. Nuju slammed the door after it and created a new lock of thick ice. Then he turned to Whenua, who was slowly powering down his drills.</p>
			<p>"Ow," said the Toa of Ice.</p>
			<p>"Sorry. All that I could think of," Whenua replied. "No one is quite sure what that thing is, possibly a hybrid of an Ussal crab and some larger creature. But we do know it's practically blind and uses its hearing to track prey."</p>
			<p>"Sensitive ears," said Nuju. "You gave it a headache."</p>
			<p>Whenua stood and helped Nuju to his feet. "Welcome to the Archives."</p>
			<h2>3</h2>
			<p>"We're lost-wandering," said Orkahm. The Le-Matoran looked fearfully around at the unfamiliar sights of Ga-Metru. "We're never going to find that Great Disk!"</p>
			<p>Vhisola gave him a hard look. "We're not lost," the Ga-Matoran snapped. "Just a little...turned around."</p>
			<p>"You said you knew where we were ground-walking."</p>
			<p>"I do!" Vhisola insisted. "It's around here, somewhere."</p>
			<p>"Enough," Nokama, Toa Metru of Water, said sternly. "Arguing won't get us to the Great Disk any faster. It might even make things worse, Vhisola," she added, pointing down the avenue.</p>
			<p>The Ga-Matoran turned to look. Then she gasped and took a step backwards. Standing beside one of the canals up ahead were three other Ga-Matoran, all of them watching the approaching group with suspicion. One of them whispered to another, who then ran off toward the Great Temple.</p>
			<p>Matau, Toa Metru of Air, watched the Ga-Matoran disappear and said, "So? They are curious-watching. What is the worry?"</p>
			<p>Nokama dropped her voice to a whisper. "It's more than that. Those Matoran have been claimed by the Bordakh, the Ga-Metru Vahki squad. One touch of a Bordakh staff and a Matoran becomes so dedicated to order that he will turn in his best friend to preserve it."</p>
			<p>"Spies," Matau replied. "Then I have a thought-plan. If it works, then we meet at the spillway quick-soon. Understand?"</p>
			<p>"Yes, but what-?"</p>
			<p>"Ha! What do you know about Great Disks?" Matau boomed loud enough for the whole street to hear. "I will track-find the disk before you three can even check one proto-dam." Then the Toa of Air swung up into a chute and was gone.</p>
			<p>The two Matoran down the road seemed to think about it for a moment, then they dashed off in the direction Matau had gone. Once Nokama was sure they were well away, she started running, dragging Vhisola and Orkahm behind her.</p>
			<p>"Hey! Stop it!" Vhisola cried.</p>
			<p>"They will not be able to find him, and once they realize that, they will come back here. We must be elsewhere."</p>
			<p>The Toa Metru of Water led them on a winding path through alleys, behind schools, over walls and finally to the site of one of Ga-Metru's mini-dams. Here tides of protodermis were held back so as not to overflow the metru's canal system. Nokama scanned the area but saw no sign of any Vahki or watchful Matoran. But she did see Matau standing in the middle of the spillway, arms folded across his chest and smiling.</p>
			<p>"What took you so long?" he laughed.</p>
			<p>"You stay here," Nokama said to Vhisola and Orkahm. "Keep an eye out for Bordakh."</p>
			<p>Before either could argue, she ran, jumped, flipped in mid-air and landed beside Matau. They were standing in a wide stone channel through which liquid protodermis flowed into the canals as needed. Right now, it was bone dry and would stay that way as long as the main valve was closed.</p>
			<p>"You lost them?" she asked.</p>
			<p>"No one catches a Toa-hero," Matau answered, leaning in close. "Unless, of course, he wants to be caught."</p>
			<p>"Provided anyone wants to catch him," Nokama replied. "If we let a little protodermis out, we can swim through some of the lesser canals right to the Great Temple. Vhisola says we will find the disk there."</p>
			<p>"Swim?" Matau said, with obvious disgust. "A Toa of Air doesn't swim-he high-flies."</p>
			<p>"If he wants to get spotted by the Vahki, he does, yes. Turn the valve, just a little, and get some protodermis running through here. I will get the Matoran."</p>
			<p>Shrugging, Matau walked over to the large wheel that controlled the valve. Then he stopped. "Nokama? This is already open-wide." He grabbed the wheel and tried to turn it, but it would not move. "And locked!"</p>
			<p>"What?" Nokama shouted, rushing toward him. She could already hear the roar of a protodermis wave heading for the spillway. "Matau, get out of here! Get-"</p>
			<p>The wave smashed into the Toa of Water, sending her tumbling end over end. An instant later, Matau, too, was swept up in the flood. Not having Nokama's experience as a swimmer, he had not thought to grab a breath. Now he floundered, hand to his throat as the liquid protodermis filled his mouth and lungs.</p>
			<p>Nokama extended her hydro blades in front of her and knifed through the protodermis. She slammed into Matau, her momentum carrying them both up toward the lip of the spillway. Then they were out of the liquid, landing hard on the stone ledge.</p>
			<p>She rolled the Toa of Air over. "Matau? Matau!" she cried.</p>
			<p>Matau choked and gasped. Then his eyes snapped open and he looked at Nokama, a smile spreading across his face. "I knew you cared."</p>
			<p>Nokama, Matau, Vhisola, and Orkahm walked hurriedly toward the Great Temple. There was no way to reach it without being seen, but they did their best to stay inconspicuous. For two Toa Metru, it wasn't easy. Matoran looked at them with wonder and awe, sometimes even fear, but none seemed hostile.</p>
			<p>"'In Ga-Metru, go beyond the depths of Toa before'," said Nokama. "That's what the carving said."</p>
			<p>"And what does that scratch-writing mean?" asked Matau.</p>
			<p>"In the sea below the Great Temple," answered Vhisola. "Far below."</p>
			<p>"Oh. Happy-cheer," said Matau, not sounding happy at all.</p>
			<p>They circled around behind the Great Temple. Only a narrow stone walkway separated the building from the sea. Nokama had already announced that she would be going down alone to retrieve the disk.</p>
			<p>"You and Orkahm are not swimmers," she told Matau. "But if something goes wrong, if I don't return, you will need Vhisola to show you the way out. So she stays here."</p>
			<p>Matau was going to argue that Toa-heroes should work together. But the memory of almost drowning in protodermis was enough to keep him quiet. "Go quick-fast then, Toa Nokama. We will be waiting."</p>
			<p>Nokama nodded, then dove into the turbulent sea of protodermis and vanished beneath the waves. Toa and Matoran stared after her, wondering what she might be encountering far below.</p>
			<p>So caught up were they that they never heard the approach of others until it was too late. Matau glanced to the left and saw to his surprise three Bordakh, staffs at the ready, closing in. Three more moved toward them from the right, leaving their only escape the cold sea.</p>
			<p>"I hate Ga-Metru," he muttered.</p>
			<p>	*	*	*</p>
			<p>Nokama was unaware of what was going on up above. She had reached the very foundation of the Great Temple and spotted her prize. Wedged between two jagged outcroppings up ahead was a Great Disk!</p>
			<p>The sight gave her renewed energy. She dove deeper and used all her new Toa strength to pry the disk loose. She checked the three-digit code and confirmed that, yes, this disk had been made in Ga-Metru and had a power level of 9. Only Great Disks possessed so much raw energy.</p>
			<p>Smiling, she tucked it under her arm and started for the surface. She never noticed that those two jagged outcroppings had been massive teeth, or that their owner objected to her intrusion. She kicked her legs and swam, even as a pair of massive jaws prepared to snap shut upon her.</p>
			<h2>4</h2>
			<p>The first thing Onewa felt was the heat. It was never this hot in Po-Metru, not even in a Sculpture Field in the middle of the day. What in the name of Mata Nui was going on?</p>
			<p>That's when he opened his eyes and saw the flames leaping in the furnace. Suddenly, he remembered the blast, the fall, everything. He shook Vakama, saying, "Wake up! Might be your last chance!"</p>
			<p>The Toa of Fire's eyes snapped open and he looked around. They had moved a long way through the chute and were almost in the mouth of the furnace. There was no time to jump out of the chute, and once inside the melting chamber, not even the power of the Toa would save them.</p>
			<p>"Don't you have a disk for this?" asked Onewa.</p>
			<p>"Quiet! I have to concentrate," Vakama answered. He reached out his hands toward the mouth of the furnace and struggled to call upon his Toa energies. He knew that he had the ability to create fire. Now he was gambling that he could control it as well.</p>
			<p>The chute brought them closer and closer to the end. Onewa wondered if his Mask of Power might be able to rescue them, then sadly remembered that he did not even know what power his mask possessed. It was up to Vakama.</p>
			<p>The Toa of Fire summoned every last bit of his willpower and hurled it at the furnace. Then, to his amazement, the fires began to flicker. He felt heat pouring into his body as the flames died down to mere sparks. Soon, even the sparks were gone.</p>
			<p>"I don't believe it," Onewa whispered. "How did you-?"</p>
			<p>"Watch out!" Vakama yelled, just before unleashing twin white-hot bursts of flame that burned a hole through the ceiling of the building. The streams of fire lasted for a long, long moment before Vakama cut them off. Then he finally collapsed, exhausted.</p>
			<p>"What did you do?"</p>
			<p>"Absorbed the fire," said Vakama, out of breath. "But I couldn't contain the power. Had to release it, or..."</p>
			<p>Onewa glanced up in time to see Nidhiki back away from the railing and vanish into the darkness. He considered giving chase, but he knew his four-legged enemy would already be long gone. Besides, there was a worse problem to be faced.</p>
			<p>"That fire blast, Vakama, it's going to bring the Vahki on the run," he said, helping the Toa of Fire to his feet. "The Nuurakh will haul us in for destruction of metru property and our mission will be over."</p>
			<p>"Nuhrii and Ahkmou?"</p>
			<p>Onewa shook his head. "My guess is we're going to have to find them. Again. Let's go."</p>
			<p>As it turned out, tracking down the two Matoran was not very difficult. Ahkmou had been to Ta-Metru before, but didn't know it well, and wasn't willing to risk running into Nidhiki. Nuhrii did know all the alleyways and shortcuts, but was too frightened to go very far. Onewa found them hiding among some chutes that were closed for repair.</p>
			<p>Vakama knelt down and looked at both of them. "Listen to me. It should be obvious now that someone doesn't want us to find the Great Disks. That means neither one of you is safe until they <i>are</i> found. Understand?"</p>
			<p>Nuhrii nodded. Ahkmou shrugged. Vakama decided that would have to be enough.</p>
			<p>"Then let's go to the fire pits."</p>
			<p>The Ta-Metru fire pits consisted of a half dozen deep, narrow craters from which spewed forth great jets of flame. A nest of underground pipelines fed the fires to wherever they were needed in the metru. Given their importance, it was no surprise that the site was fenced in and guarded by Nuurakh.</p>
			<p>"Can't we just go up and tell them why we need the disk?" asked Nuhrii.</p>
			<p>"If they listened, and if they believed us, and if they were willing to take us to Turaga Dume and explain, maybe we would get the disk," said Onewa. "Or maybe not. So we bend the rules. Hey, you can't make a sculpture without shattering some protodermis, right?"</p>
			<p>"We need a distraction," said Vakama.</p>
			<p>Onewa smiled. "Done."</p>
			<p>A few moments later, they were in position. Vakama and Nuhrii had crept as close to the fence as they could without being seen. Onewa and Ahkmou had moved near a pile of stone left over from a recent excavation.</p>
			<p>At Vakama's signal, Onewa focused his elemental power. First, one block of stone went flying to crash against the fence. Then two, then six, until the Vahki rushed over to see what was happening. Onewa got a little carried away and sent a block crashing into one of the Nuurakh.</p>
			<p>As soon as the Vahki had left their posts, Vakama and Nuhrii rushed forward. Vakama used his power to heat up the fence and melt a hole for the two of them. "Are you sure you know which fire pit contains the disk?" the Toa Metru whispered.</p>
			<p>"I saw a carving," answered Nuhrii. "I think it was correct."</p>
			<p>The Matoran led Vakama to the lip of one of the pits. The Toa of Fire peered over, then jumped back as the flames roared from it. Once the fires subsided, he said, "Come on, we don't have long!"</p>
			<p>Melting handholds in the sides of the pit, Vakama climbed down with Nuhrii clinging to him. Down below, he could see a disk wedged into the wall, somehow intact despite the intense heat. Vakama reached down and pried it loose. Yes, it did have the symbol of Tas-Metru on it, and its three-digit disk code indicated it had a power level of 9-the highest known concentration of energy possible in a Kanoka disk.</p>
			<p>This was a Great Disk!</p>
			<p>"We have it," said Vakama. "Climb over me and get out of the pit."</p>
			<p>Nuhrii clambered over Vakama's shoulders, but before he could make it to the surface, twin Morbuzakh vines shot up from the depths below. They wrapped themselves tightly around Toa and Matoran and began to drag them down into the fire pit.</p>
			<p>"Free yourself and get out of here! Get the Great Disk to Onewa!" Vakama shouted.</p>
			<p>"I can't, it's too strong! We're Vahki bones!" Nuhrii answered, frantic. "The fire pit will erupt at any moment!"</p>
			<p>The Toa of Fire redoubled his efforts but the more he struggled, the harder the vine pulled. Worse, he was bound in such a way that there was no room in the pit for him to aim and launch a disk.</p>
			<p>"Nuhrii, can you reach my last disk? I need you to load it in the launcher."</p>
			<p>The Matoran nodded and strained to reach the disk. He could just barely brush his fingertips against it. "I can't reach!"</p>
			<p>"Try! It's more than just us-the whole city is at stake," said Vakama.</p>
			<p>Nuhrii stretched until the pain was so great he could barely think straight. But his hand closed around the disk. "It's a power level 4," he reported. "Power code 1."</p>
			<p>As Nuhrii fitted the disk in the launcher, Vakama continued to fight to get free. Power code 1 was able to reconstitute whatever it touched at random. It was a dangerous disk to use because it was just as apt to make the Morbuzakh more powerful than less. But they had no choice.</p>
			<p>Nuhrii wrestled against the might of the Morbuzakh to get the launcher into the right position. When it was as well-aimed as he could manage, he triggered the mechanism and launched the disk at the spot where the two vines joined.</p>
			<p>It struck the target head-on. Vakama watched, amazed, as the molecules that made up the vines were scrambeld. The shock made the plant loosen its grip. The Toa of Fire and Nuhrii scrambled out of the pit.</p>
			<p>Vakama caught a flash of the new form of the Morbuzakh-a thick vine with long, sharp thorns and what looked like a mouth lined with razor-sharp teeth. It gave out an eerie howl and tried to reach Vakama, just as the pit exploded into flames again. The Toa Metru knew the flames would not destroy the vine, but he had no wish to wait around and see that horror again.</p>
			<p>Toa and Matoran ran for the fence. Both made a point of not looking behind them.</p>
			<h2>5</h2>
			<p>"What about this one?" asked Nuju, pointing to a metallic door that looked thick and solid.</p>
			<p>Whenua turned, looked, and shook his head. "No. It's not behind that one."</p>
			<p>"How do you know?"</p>
			<p>"Because I know what's in there. Leave it alone."</p>
			<p>Nuju glared at the Toa of Earth. Back in Ko-Metru, Nuju had been an important scholar with vital responsibilities. Now he was a Toa Metru, reduced to tramping around dark, musty Archives looking for one relic among thousands. So far, he had been squeezed in an Ussal crab claw, weakened by a frost leech, stepped in something whose origin he really did not want to know, and gotten hopelessly lost at least twice. He was covered in the dust of the past and he did not like it.</p>
			<p>"Whenua doesn't seem to have any idea what is down here," Nuju muttered to himself. "So how does he know the Great Disk isn't behind this door?"</p>
			<p>Checking to make sure the Toa of Earth was otherwise occupied, Nuju grasped the handle of the door and pulled. Surprisingly, it wasn't locked. It took his eyes a moment to adjust to the even deeper darkness behind the door. Once they had, he noticed something that seemed to be shimmering. Could the Great Disk create an effect like that?</p>
			<p>He took a step inside, then another, before his progress was stopped by a clear wall. No, it wasn't a wall. It was the side of a tank filled with liquid protodermis. He pressed his mask against the glass, trying to see what, if anything, was in there.</p>
			<p>Suddenly something slammed hard against the inside of the tank, right where Nuju was standing. Before the Toa could react, it had circled and smashed into the tank wall again, this time creating a hairline crack. On its third pass, Nuju got a good look at it, and wished he hadn't. The creature was long, serpent-like, with powerful forearms and, most disturbing, two heads. Both heads featured narrow greenish eyes and a fanged mouth.</p>
			<p>Nuju jumped back as it struck again. Now protodermis was starting to leak from the tank, but this was something he could handle. A minimal amount of power was enough to freeze it and seal the crack. But his presence had obviously disturbed the creature, so he felt that he had better leave.</p>
			<p>He turned around. Whenua was standing in the doorway, watching him.</p>
			<p>"Done?" asked the Toa of Earth. "Listen, I know you don't like it here. It's not neat and orderly like Ko-Metru. Archivists don't sit in clean towers studying all day, they are out getting their hands dirty. But we have rules here too-like don't annoy the two-headed Tarakava, if at all possible."</p>
			<p>Nuju nodded. "It does seem...excitable."</p>
			<p>"Last ones to excite it before it came here were two Ga-Matoran in a fishing skiff," Whenua said, turning and walking away. "They were lucky to make it out of the sea. The skiff wound up as sawdust."</p>
			<p>Nuju said nothing. He followed behind Whenua, reminding himself that even in a place devoted to the dead past, actions could have consequences.</p>
			<p>Whenua stopped at another doorway. His expression was troubled. "It could be in here. It probably would be in here, the way things are going. But, by Mata Nui, I hope it's not."</p>
			<p>This door actually had a sign, which read "Keep out". Nuju wondered what could be behind there that would worry Whenua so much. After all, two Toa Metru should be able to handle anything.</p>
			<p>Whenua hesitated before using his earthshock drill to punch through the lock. "I hope we're ready for this. The last archivist that came down here hasn't spoken a word since. Screams a lot, though."</p>
			<p>Nuju readied both of his crystal spikes, in case his ice power would be needed. Whenua slowly opened the door and the two of them stepped inside.</p>
			<p>They found themselves in a large, brightly lit room. It was completely bare. There was no sign that any creature lived there, or ever had lived there. Nuju frowned. <i>This didn't look very frightening at all. What had Whenua been so worried about?</i></p>
			<p>Both Toa Metru whirled at the sound of the door slamming behind them. Even more surprising, Nuju could see the hole made by Whenua's drills disappearing. They were locked in.</p>
			<p>"What is this?" asked Nuju.</p>
			<p>"No one knows exactly," said Whenua, looking all around. "Our best theory is that this creature has some connection to the random reconstitution disk power."</p>
			<p>"<i>What</i> creature? There's nothing here!" said Nuju.</p>
			<p>"You don't understand," Whenua replied, as the lightstones suddenly began to dim. "This Rahi isn't in the room. It <i>is</i> the room!"</p>
			<p>The floor beneath Nuju's feet began to shift. A pair of clawed hands emerged from the stone to grasp him around the ankles. A much larger hand sprang forth from one of the walls and narrowly missed grabbing Whenua. The room echoed with a low, ominous rumble that sounded like the breathing of a massive creature.</p>
			<p>The Toa of Earth dove toward where Nuju stood. Spikes shot out of the walls just above him, but Whenua was too nimble to be caught. He grabbed the two hands holding Nuju and wrenched them free. The roar in the room grew louder and angrier.</p>
			<p>Now the floor was rising fast, sending both Toa toward a crushing end against the ceiling. Nuju fired streams of ice from his crystal spikes, forming thick pillars to keep floor and ceiling apart. But he knew they would not hold for long.</p>
			<p>"We have to get out of here," he said.</p>
			<p>"Any ideas?" asked Whenua.</p>
			<p>"I was hoping you had one."</p>
			<p>Whenua smiled. "Mabye I do. You can do ice, but what else can you do?"</p>
			<p>Nuju needed no more prompting. He gathered his energies and concentrated on conjuring a storm. It was incredibly hard, unskilled as he still was in the use of his elemental powers. But little by little the air began to turn colder, and a chill wind started to blow through the confines of the room. Moisture in the air condensed into droplets, which then froze into crystals of snow.</p>
			<p>Nuju strained to lower the temperature more, and then still more. Beside him, Whenua shivered, frost forming on his mask. It was an open question who would succumb to the storm first, the Toa Metru or the creature that had trapped them.</p>
			<p>Then Whenua was pointing to something on the far wall. Nuju strained to see through the snow and ice. It looked like an opening in the wall. As the two Toa moved toward it, a wave passed through the floor beneath them, hurling them toward the gap. They flew out of the room and crashed against the wall of the hallway. Behind them, the gap closed again.</p>
			<p>Whenua groaned and brushed the ice off his body. "I guess it worked. This hasn't been as easy as I thought it would be."</p>
			<p>"Maybe that's the first lesson in the life of a Toa," replied Nuju. "Nothing is easy."</p>
			<p>The Toa of Ice was starting to feel he was walking in circles. This sub-level of the Archives seemed to go on forever, and he felt certain they had seen some of these doors before. But Whenua insisted that wasn't so.</p>
			<p>"If it's here, we will have to find it soon," the Toa of Earth insisted. "We have explored almost the entire level. I don't think-"</p>
			<p>He stopped abruptly and cocked his head, listening to something. Now Nuju could hear it too-the steady tramp of feet from somewhere in the halls. The footsteps were too heavy to be Matoran, and anyway archivists avoided this section.</p>
			<p>Whenua glanced at Nuju. "We just ran out of time. The Vahki are coming. Someone must have heard all the noise down here and called for them."</p>
			<p>The Toa of Earth started frantically opening doors. "We're down here without authorization, planning to take an artifact. Never mind that it's in a good cause. You know the Onu-Metru Vahki. The Rorzakh will chase us through this entire place and all the way back to the Great Temple before they give up!"</p>
			<p>Nuju had to admit he was right. Even in Ko-Metru, Matoran knew never to get a Rorzakh on their trail. There was no risk they wouldn't take to get their job done. There was even a story that a Rorzakh had once plunged into a mine shaft, in free fall, to try and catch a lawbreaker.</p>
			<p>The Toa of Ice started pulling open doors on the run. "I never imagined being a Toa would involve searching for so many things. I thought Toa had everything they needed."</p>
			<p>"Maybe not," said Whenua. "Maybe Toa are just the only ones who have the power to find what has to be found."</p>
			<p>The Toa of Earth yanked another door open. An avalanche of Metru Nui artifacts tumbled out, knocking him off his feet and burying him beneath a pile of tools, masks, stone tablets, and more.</p>
			<p>For a moment, all was silent. Nuju took a step toward the pile when the artifacts started to shift. Then Whenua's hand shot out of the pile, holding the Great Disk.</p>
			<p>Nuju smiled. It was time to gather the two Matoran and head to Ko-Metru where, he was certain, the search for the Great Disk would proceed in a much more orderly way.</p>
			<h2>6</h2>
			<p>Nokama swam in long, steady strokes, her eyes focused on the surface. She could make out indistinct figures through the water. There was Matau, and Vhisola, Orkahm, and...Vahki!</p>
			<p>The sight made her stop short. Only then did she sense the disturbance in the water, as if nature itself were crying out to her. She whirled to see the giant sea beast closing in on her. She wanted to scream, but opening her mouth underwater would save the Rahi the trouble of ending her existence.</p>
			<p>Nokama forced her fear away. It was all right for a Matoran to be afraid, but she was a Toa now. She could fight back, and just maybe solve two problems at once.</p>
			<p>Clutching the Great Disk tightly, she sped for the surface. The monstrous Rahi was right on top of her, caught up in the hunt and determined to catch a meal. Nokama burst out of the water and into the air, diving toward one group of Vahki. The beast followed close behind, leaping, jaws snapping, hungry for its prey.</p>
			<p>At the last possible moment, Nokama curled into a ball and flipped downwards. Unable to change direction, the Rahi slammed into the startled Vahki. Matau used the distraction to summon a strong wind and blow the other Vahki into the water.</p>
			<p>"Now we are in trouble-danger," said Matau. 'Vahki hate fish. And baths."</p>
			<p>"Then let's not wait for their complaints," said Nokama. "We have the disk. Let's go!"</p>
			<p>The four did not stop running until they had reached the borders of Le-Metru. Here they lost themselves in the crowds that filled the transport hub of Metru Nui. Vhisola kept looking over her shoulder as if she expected the Vahki to be gaining.</p>
			<p>"Why am I here?" she asked. "You have the Ga-Metru disk. I don't know anything about the Le-Metru disk! Why can't I go home?"</p>
			<p>"You are safer with us," said Nokama.</p>
			<p>"Yes, four-legged Rahi-breath out there somewhere," added Matau. "You wouldn't want to run into him."</p>
			<p>Neither Toa Metru chose to tell the whole story. Each of the six Matoran who had joined the Toa on their quest for the disks had their own reasons for wanting the artifacts. For some, it was personal glory, for some spite, and the heroes believed Ahkmou wanted the disks for far darker reasons. Both Nokama and Matau felt letting either of their Matoran wander off was risking more trouble with the Vahki, or worse.</p>
			<p>Matau led them to a strangely quiet section of the metru, marked by broken chutes and mangled support beams. No repair crews were in sight, nor any chute operators. Nokama glanced at Matau, who said simply, "Morbuzakh."</p>
			<p>The Toa of Water looked around, concerned. An area of the metru ravaged by Morbuzakh vines would make a good hiding place, but it also meant the plant might strike here again. They would have to be on their guard.</p>
			<p>"What did the carving-speak say about the Le-Metru disk?" Matau asked.</p>
			<p>"The Great Disk of Le-Metru will be all around when you find it," answered Nokama.</p>
			<p>Matau looked left and right. "I don't see it."</p>
			<p>"That's because it's not here," said Orkahm. "You won't find it by moving fast, Matau. As hard as it might be for you, you will have to slow down to retrieve it."</p>
			<p>Matau frowned. To a high-flying Toa Metru like him, "slow down" sounded like a curse. "So where is it hidden-lost?"</p>
			<p>"That's just it," said Orkahm. "I found it, but it's not in that place anymore. It could be anywhere by now. It's in a force sphere!"</p>
			<p>Matau sat down heavily, his eyes on the ground. Nokama looked from him to Orkahm and back again. "Is that bad?" she asked.</p>
			<p>"Very," Matau replied, nodding. "Very, very."</p>
			<p>"Is someone going to explain to me what's going on, or do you need a downpour to convince you?" she snapped.</p>
			<p>"All right, you know what a chute is?" said Orkahm. "It's protodermis with a magnetic energy sheath that keeps things fast-moving through it. Sometimes, if there's a break-flaw in the chute construction, some of that energy snaps off and wraps-folds in on itself."</p>
			<p>"It travels everquick through the chutes," said Matau. "Its magnetism draws things inside: tools, debris...and a Great Disk. The longer it exists, the more mighty-strong it becomes."</p>
			<p>"And then what happens?" asked Nokama, not sure she wanted to hear the answer.</p>
			<p>"When it gets big enough and strong enough, it rips-tears chutes to pieces," said the Toa of Air. "Force sphere gets deep-buried under the wreckage and implodes. All gone."</p>
			<p>"Along with everything inside it," said Nokama grimly. "We have to find it!"</p>
			<p>Orkahm pulled out a chute map of Le-Metru and showed it to the two Toa, pointing to one junction close by. "It was here just before Toa Matau and I high-flew to the Great Temple."</p>
			<p>Toa Matau traced the force sphere's most likely route until he came to a spot on the map that looked to Nokama like a complete tangle of chutes. "There! Too many chutes wrapped around each other will slow it down. We'll find it there!"</p>
			<p>"There" turned out to be an ancient portion of the metru, apparently built long before anyone tried making sense of the chute system. Nokama had never seen anything quite so complex or scrambled together. She wondered how any Matoran made it through what Matau called "the Notch".</p>
			<p>The Toa of Air was perched up above one of the chutes, his keen eyes scanning the route. If he was right, the force sphere would come flying by any moment. All he would have to do would be jump inside it, grab the Great Disk, and then get back out.</p>
			<p>"Easy!" he insisted. "Except for the getting out. And the getting in. And maybe seek-finding the disk."</p>
			<p>Orkahm cried out. The force sphere was barreling through the chute, heading for the Notch at an incredible rate of speed. It was larger than a Toa and its interior was a whirlpool of magnetic energy and protodermis fragments. Nokama questioned whether anything living could survive in there.</p>
			<p>If Matau was worried, he didn't show it. As the sphere passed through the chute beneath him, he dove inside.</p>
			<p>Instantly, the energies of the sphere took hold of him, threatening to tear him to pieces. Tools, bolts, and other small items swirled about him in a mad dance, striking him again and again. Meanwhile, the sphere continued on its rapid pace toward the Notch.</p>
			<p>Outside, Orkahm's eyes widened. He and Matau had been wrong. The sphere was not going to slow down for the Notch! It was going to rip it to pieces and then collapse in on itself, taking the Toa of Air and the Great Disk with it.</p>
			<p>Matau could sense what was happening, but it was too late to do anything about it. If he jumped out now, he would lose the Great Disk and the city would be doomed. If he stayed, at least there was a slim chance he could-</p>
			<p>Yes! Reaching out blindly, he had grasped something that felt like a disk. Fighting the pull of the sphere, he brought it close enough to his mask to see it was indeed the Le-Metru Great Disk. As he admired it, a chunk of protodermis smashed into his hand, almost making him lose his grip.</p>
			<p>Matau couldn't see out of the sphere, but he knew the Notch had to be coming up fast. He had to overcome the sphere's pull and leap out now, but there was nothing to brace himself against. Without that, he could do nothing but tumble helplessly like all the rest of the sphere's captive debris.</p>
			<p><i>My own strength will not be enough,</i> he told himself. <i>I will have to match my Toa-power against it.</i></p>
			<p>The last time Matau had used his elemental abilities, it had taken all his concentration to form just a simple cushion of air. This time, it seemed to come a little easier, but he was also attempting a much harder task. It was going to take a mini-cyclone to overcome the force sphere's power and tear himself free.</p>
			<p>There was no time to let the winds build up slowly. Matau pushed his powers to their limit, forcing the air around him to swirl violently. Suddenly, he was in the center of a whirlwind which sucked the breath from his lungs. It was an open question whether the implosion would end his existence or suffocation would do it first.</p>
			<p>The world became a blur as Matau spun around and around inside the cyclone. He could feel himself beginning to black out, but knew if he did, the windstorm would cease and any hope of escaping the sphere would be gone. He fought to stay conscious. After all, it wouldn't look very impressive to Nokama if the Toa of Air perished on his first big mission.</p>
			<p>Then suddenly he was flying through the air. It took him an instant to realize he had been thrown free of the force sphere. Unfortunately, his whirlwind was still active, sending him hurling into a support post with a loud crash.</p>
			<p>Nokama, Vhisola, and Orkahm ran over to where Matau lay on the ground. The Toa of Air wasn't moving. Hesitantly, Nokama reached out and touched his shoulder. "Matau?"</p>
			<p>He rolled over abruptly and, smiling, thrust up a hand holding the Great Disk. "See, Nokama?" he said. "I told you, no worry-problem!"</p>
			<h2>7</h2>
			<p>In Metru Nui, Ko-Matoran were known for many things. Their devotion to learning was second to none. Their ambition to become Knowledge Tower scholars was incredibly powerful. Their attitude toward Matoran from other metru was usually cold, and sometimes bordered on rude. Since they almost always had their attention focused on a tablet, a carving, or some complicated philosophical problem, they often missed things going on around them.</p>
			<p>That was why none of the Ko-Matoran bothered to look up and notice the Toa Metru Whenua hanging on to a tower for dear life.</p>
			<p>"I thought you were good at this," Nuju snapped, scrambling to pull his fellow Toa back onto the roof.</p>
			<p>"No, that's Onewa who swings around buildings," shouted Whenua. "I'm Whenua, who falls off them!"</p>
			<p>With a mighty heave, Nuju succeeded in yanking the Toa of Earth back to relative safety on top of the ice-covered Knowledge Tower. Whenua immediately used his earthshock drills to dig himself handholds.</p>
			<p>"Don't damage the crystal underneath," warned Nuju. "I should have gone with my first instinct and done this by myself. I knew what the consequences of this alliance would be."</p>
			<p>"We worked together all right in Onu-Metru. Remember? Oh, I forgot, you ignore the past, don't you?" Whenua replied. "Besides, if you worked alone, you would probably just wind up like poor Tehutti."</p>
			<p>The Onu-Matoran was standing on a nearby rooftop with Ehrye, his eyes wide and confused. Ehrye had a grip on his arm to keep him from wandering off. The four of them had encountered a patrol of Keerakh, the Ko-Metru Vahki, and Tehutti had made the mistake of running. One swipe of a Keerakh staff and he lost all sense of time and place. Judging by the things he had said since, Tehutti thought he was back in the Archives cataloging a Fikou spider exhibit.</p>
			<p>"Are you sure the Great Disk is up here?" Whenua asked, getting cautiously to his feet. The winds were strong this high up and the Knowledge Tower rooftops had steep inclines. One slip and down he would tumble again.</p>
			<p>"You were there when Nokama translated the carving," replied Nuju. "In Ko-Metru, find where the sky and ice are joined. Besides, Ehrye says it is near here, atop one of these Knowledge Towers."</p>
			<p>Nuju stood at the edge of the roof and studied the gap between this tower and the next. His first attempt to travel by ice slide had failed miserably, so he was reluctant to do it again. Better to leap and rely on his crystal spikes to stop any fall.</p>
			<p>Taking a running start, Nuju jumped into space. He had gauged his leap perfectly, arcing down close enough to the next tower that he could catch the side with a spike and anchor himself. Back on the other roof, Whenua looked on, frustrated.</p>
			<p>Nuju raised his free spike and fired a blast of ice. When he was done, there was a thick, frozen beam in place between the two towers. "Wrap your arms around it and slide across," he instructed Whenua.</p>
			<p>The Toa of Earth did some quick calculations, which included his new mass post-transformation, the thickness of the ice, and the velocity he would achieve just before he was smashed flat on the ground below. When he was done, he reported, "It will never hold."</p>
			<p>"Yes, it will," Nuju insisted. "Probably," he added quietly.</p>
			<p>Whenua jumped, caught the ice beam, and rapidly slid across the gap. He had made it halfway when the ice began to crack and splinter behind him. He struck the side of the building and dug in his earthshock drills even as the beam collapsed completely.</p>
			<p>"Ko-Metru needs more chutes," Whenua muttered.</p>
			<p>"Most Ko-Matoran don't travel by rooftop," said Nuju. "Look below."</p>
			<p>Looking down was not high on Whenua's list of things to do, but the urgency in Nuju's voice left no room for argument. The Ko-Matoran far below looked like microscopic organisms, but those weren't what Nuju was pointing out. No, it was the half dozen Keerakh scuttling through the crowd and heading right for this particular Knowledge Tower that had the Toa of Ice worried.</p>
			<p>"I thought we had left them far behind," said Whenua.</p>
			<p>"Keerakh are efficient," answered Nuju. "We are not where we're supposed to be. It's their job to change that. Keep moving."</p>
			<p>The two Toa Metru made it to the top of the tower. Whenua looked over the side and saw the Keerakh were climbing up the side of the building. "We have problems, Nuju."</p>
			<p>"Worse than you know," said Nuju, pointing to the next tower. Three more of the Ko-Metru Vahki were gathered on its roof, waiting. "Keerakh have found a way to take the element of chance out of tracking. They simply figure out where you are going and get there first."</p>
			<p>"Have a plan?"</p>
			<p>"Something like that," said Nuju, levelling his crystal spike and sending a blast of ice at Whenua. Instantly, the Toa of Earth was covered in a thick layer of ice from shoulders to knees.</p>
			<p>"What are you doing?" Whenua demanded, struggling in vain to get free.</p>
			<p>Nuju ignored him and turned to the Vahki on the opposite roof. "After a long pursuit, I have caught this thief from Onu-Metru. Take him to Turaga Dume for punishment."</p>
			<p>The three Vahki looked at each other, obviously trying to figure out when the strange being with the twin spikes joined their side. With the closest thing Keerakh could give to a shrug, they sprang from their perch to take custody of Whenua.</p>
			<p>In mid-leap, Nuju caught them with an ice blast and froze them solid. One swipe of his spike shattered the ice surrounding Whenua. "The Vahki have kindly provided us with a bridge. Let's use it."</p>
			<p>The two Toa Metru ran across the bridge of frozen Keerakh to the next roof. Nuju looked over his shoulder to make sure Ehrye and Tehutti were well-hidden a few towers back, then turned his attention to Whenua. "Are you all right?"</p>
			<p>"Well, I won't be in a hurry to visit the icier parts of the Archives for a while," the Toa of Earth replied. "Next time, give me a little warning."</p>
			<p>"All right. Hit the ground," said Nuju as he dove flat on the roof. Whenua joined him just as Nuju used his spikes to create a thin layer of snow and ice over them both. "Keep quiet," the Toa of Ice whispered.</p>
			<p>Whenua could barely make out what was going on outside their icy shell. He spotted the shapes of the Keerakh reaching the top of the other roof. Half of them immediately went to work chipping away at the ice bridge while the other half crossed it in pursuit. One walked right over where the Toa lay, camouflaged.</p>
			<p>Whenua started to rise. Nuju grabbed his arm and said softly, "Not yet. Wait."</p>
			<p>"Wait? Wait for what?"</p>
			<p>"You're the archivist," Nuju said quietly. "What do you know about Keerakh?"</p>
			<p>"Let's see. Ko-Metru Vahki. Order enforcement technique is disorientation. Hard to hide from because they're always one...step...head of..." Whenua smiled.</p>
			<p>"Exactly," said Nuju. "I do not know how they do it, but they do. So rather than run from them-"</p>
			<p>"We follow them," Whenua finished. "And they lead us right to the Great Disk."</p>
			<p>Of course, following Vahki was easier said than done. In their dormant state, Vahki occupied a circular hive, with one Vahki monitoring each direction. Though they appeared to be completely inactive, Vahki sensory apparatus never fully shut down. Any sound or movement was instantly detected. When Vahki traveled, they moved in much the same way, always with an eye turned toward the flanks and rear.</p>
			<p>For that reason, Nuju had recommended that Ehrye and Tehutti be left behind. Tehutti kept ranting about misfiled Fikou anyway, and Ehrye was in no hurry to walk into a possible Keerakh trap. So the two Toa Metru traveled alone, relying on speed and stealth to keep up with the Vahki and keep out of sight.</p>
			<p>Their journey ended at a central tower. The half dozen Vahki paused there and began to mill around. After a few moments, each Keerakh locked its four legs into place on the icy roof and settled in to wait.</p>
			<p>Nuju frowned. "Of course, there is one problem with this plan."</p>
			<p>"That's a change-you not thinking ahead," said Whenua. "Maybe what the Vahki need is a little disorder. Get me down from up here."</p>
			<p>Nuju moved to the far edge of the rooftop and checked to make sure the Vahki had not yet noticed their presence. Then he used his elemental energies to create a thick pole of ice stretching from the roof to the avenue below.</p>
			<p>"I was thinking more like pointing me toward a chute," said Whenua.</p>
			<p>"This is faster."</p>
			<p>"Right. At least it will be over quick," said Whenua, getting ready to ride down the pole. "When you see your opportunity, get that disk. I'll meet you in Ga-Metru."</p>
			<p>Nuju watched as the Toa of Earth slid down and vanished in the icy mist. Then he went back to watching the Vahki.</p>
			<p>Down below, Whenua was doing his best not to get sick. He was moving much too fast, with no way to slow down. At this rate, he would succeed in distracting the Vahki by making a very large hole in the street.</p>
			<p>On the rooftop above, Nuju was counting quietly to himself. When he reached 10, he launched two more bursts of ice from his crystal spikes. They arced over the side of the building and disappeared.</p>
			<p>Whenua saw the ice bolts approach and then pass him. The next thing he knew, he was flying down a winding ice slide that had suddenly formed around the pole. The angle of the slide kept changing so that, little by little, Whenua's descent was slowed. He still hit the ground hard, but Nuju's calculations were correct. The Toa of Earth hadn't suffered any serious injury.</p>
			<p><i>That's the second time he's surprised me today,</i> thought Whenua. <i>Hope it isn't going to become a habit.</i></p>
			<p>He looked around. A few Ko-Matoran had looked up from their studies long enough to notice that a Toa Metru had just dropped into their midst. It was only a matter of time before one summoned additional Vahki. Whenua went to work, using his earthshock drills to cut a hole in the street.</p>
			<p>Once the opening was wide enough, the Toa dropped down. As an archivist, he knew the underground of Metru Nui better than any of the other Toa. Immediately beneath the streets were mechanisms designed to help keep the metru clean, protodermis pipes, and the occasional nest of rodent Rahi. Farther down would be whatever sub-levels of the Archives had extended this far, and beneath that....beneath that, he preferred not to think about.</p>
			<p>For now, he was only worried about the immediate sub-surface. Using one drill to bore through the street above, he used the other to disrupt the cleaning mechanisms, break the occasional narrow pipe, and generally make a mess. He made no effort to keep it quiet-the more noise the better.</p>
			<p>He knew what would be happening above right now. Ko-Matoran would be looking around in wonder and annoyance at the disturbance. The sound would be traveling up to the sensitive ears of the Vahki. They would never be able to resist the chance to clamp down on such obvious disorder.</p>

			<p>High above, the Vahki were proving Whenua right. First one, then two, peered over the side of the roof to see what was happening below. Unable to get a good look due to the icy mist that perpetually hovered over Ko-Metru, the Vahki squad left their positions and began climbing down the side of the Knowledge Tower.</p>
			<p>Nuju waited until they were gone, then leaped to the next roof. He was sure the Great Disk must be there somewhere, but he saw no sign of it. He scrambled to get a little higher on the inclined roof and slipped, hurtling toward the edge.</p>
			<p>Before he could put his crystal spikes to use, he had fallen over the side. At the last moment, he reached out and grabbed a huge icicle that hung from the ledge. It wasn't unusual to see icicles up this high, but he quickly noticed that this one was just a little different from the rest.</p>
			<p>Frozen in its heart was a Great Disk.</p>
			<p>Beneath the street, Whenua continued his labors, keeping an eye on the hole through which he had come. As soon as he saw Keerakh peering down through it, he knew it was time to be elsewhere. Revving up his drills, he punched a hole through the floor and then through the next level as well. Plunging through the gap, he tumbled into an Archives sub-level.</p>
			<p>No Ko-Metru Vahki would ever find him down here. He took off at a run, following the winding corridors in the direction of Ga-Metru. If all had gone well, he would meet Nuju there with two Great Disks between them.</p>
			<h2>8</h2>
			<p>Toa Onewa and Ahkmou walked side by side through the Po-Metru sculpture fields, Vakama and Nuhrii bringing up the rear. The journey had been made largely in silence, with the exception of Ahkmou giving directions to the hiding place of the Great Disk. They had already taken a few wrong turns thanks to the Matoran's "forgetting" exactly where it was concealed.</p>
			<p>"It's not far," Ahkmou said.</p>
			<p>"That's the tenth time you've said that," Onewa replied. "I'm beginning to think you don't want us to find the Great Disk."</p>
			<p>"Of course I do," said Ahkmou. "Okay, so maybe I wanted them for myself at first. But now I realize that you six Toa need them to save the whole city. I wouldn't get in the way of that. Only, what are you going to do with the Great Disks once you have them?"</p>
			<p>Onewa shrugged. "I don't know. This is Vakama's plan. I suppose we'll give them to him."</p>
			<p>Ahkmou chuckled. "I see. So he gets all of you to go out and gather the six most powerful items in all of Metru Nui, and then you just turn them over to him? No questions asked? I wish I had thought of that."</p>
			<p><i>I bet you do,</i> thought Onewa darkly.</p>
			<p>"So who's this four-legged friend of yours? The one who likes pushing Toa into furnaces?" asked the Toa of Stone.</p>
			<p>"He's no friend," answered Ahkmou. "We were...business partners. He asked me to get him the Great Disks. Doing it seemed like a better idea than having him angry at me. He didn't say why he wanted them."</p>
			<p>"And you didn't ask. What did he promise you in return?"</p>
			<p>"Protection," said Ahkmou. "Something we both need right now. Look!"</p>
			<p>Po-Matoran were running from the Sculpture Fields in a panic. Only two things had been known to make crafters move that fast: quitting time and a rogue tunneler. Unfortunately, it was too early for work to be done for the day.</p>
			<p>Tunnelers had been a problem in Po-Metru for as long as Onewa could remember. They were lizard-like Rahi, normally about twice as long as Matoran were tall, with an appetite for solid protodermis. They had been known to dig up into warehouses and consume everything from raw protodermis blocks to finished tools. Rarely did they pose a real threat to the Matoran workers, but every now and then one went bad and began rampaging through the work areas.</p>
			<p>Vakama and Nuhrii had caught up now. "What's going on?" asked the Toa of Fire.</p>
			<p>"A little problem," said Onewa.</p>
			<p>"A big problem," corrected Ahkmou.</p>
			<p>The tunneler had emerged from beneath the surface into the middle of the Sculpture Field. It was bigger than any Onewa had ever seen, easily three times the size of a Toa. Worse, its scales were mottled with dark patches and its eyes were red. In a tunneler, both were sure signs of madness.</p>
			<p>"Maybe I can scare it off," suggested Vakama. Before Onewa could stop him, he had lobbed a few small fireballs in the direction of the tunneler. Not wanting to hurt the beast, Vakama had aimed well over its head.</p>
			<p>If the tunneler could have smiled, it would have. As the fireballs approached, it reared up on its hind legs and purposely let itself be hit. An instant later, it had transformed from a creature of scales and claws to a monster of flame.</p>
			<p>"We're not in your metru, Vakama. Fire's not the answer to everything," Onewa said sharply. "Tunnelers absorb whatever power you throw at them. We've gone from a menace to a catastrophe."</p>
			<p>All around the creature, sculptures had begun to melt. Every step it took left a charred footprint in the soil. Even at a great distance, the two Toa Metru could feel the heat.</p>
			<p>"If that thing makes it out of the Sculpture Fields, all of Po-Metru could burn," said Onewa. "Let's see if it wants to play catch."</p>
			<p>The Toa of Stone lifted a huge boulder and prepared to throw it. Vakama couldn't understand his strategy-most of the rock would melt before it ever reached the tunneler, and what was left wouldn't do any damage.</p>
			<p>Onewa tossed the boulder. It began to glow and melt as it got closer to its target. But enough made it through that the tunneler had to bat the fragments away with its tail. As soon as rock met tunneler, the creature transformed again, this time becoming a thing of stone.</p>
			<p>"Well, that helps a little," said Onewa. The tunneler brushed lightly against a massive sculpture, and the statue crumbled from the blow. "Or not."</p>
			<p>"I have an idea, but we'll need Nuhrii and Ahkmou's help," said Vakama. He turned around and saw both Matoran were gone. A moment later, he heard the sounds of a struggle from behind one of the sculptures.</p>
			<p>The Toa of Fire looked behind the statue. Nuhrii had Ahkmou pinned on the ground. "He was trying to run away again," said the Ta-Matoran. "But he brought us here. Seems to me he should help us get out again."</p>
			<p>"You're both going to help. Here's what we're going to do."</p>
			<p>The tunneler slowly blinked its stone eyes. Two of the little ones were still in its sight, jumping and yelling in a language it didn't understand. The two larger ones had disappeared. Ordinarily, there was no cause to harm little ones, unless they got in the way of a meal. But these two were annoying with their noise.</p>
			<p>With a snarl, the tunneler lumbered forward to silence them.</p>
			<p>"Now!" shouted Onewa. He slung his proto piton onto a nearby statue and he and Vakama swung from their perch high above. As they passed over the tunneler, Vakama unleashed a quick, intense fire blast at the ground.</p>
			<p>Fire met sand right in front of the creature, fusing the ground into glass. Startled by the light and heat, the creature whipped its tail forward, striking the new glass surface. That was all it took for the tunneler of stone to change into a tunneler of crystal.</p>
			<p>The creature spotted the two Toa Metru and started to take a step forward, only to be stopped by the sound of a sharp crack. Its new glass body wasn't strong enough to support the tunneler's size. Every move it made caused another hairline fracture to appear, so the tunneler wisely decided to stay still.</p>
			<p>"That should keep it occupied until the Vahki arrive," said Onewa. "Then the archivists can decide what to do with it."</p>
			<p>Onewa looked up at the tallest sculpture he had ever seen. It looked like an upside down mountain, balancing on its peak. Nokama had said that the Toa must seek a "mountain in balance" if they were to find the Po-Metru Great Disk. This certainly looked like the spot.</p>
			<p>"It's up there," confirmed Ahkmou. "Embedded in a jagged hole near the top. Good luck getting it out."</p>
			<p>The thought of the climb made even the Toa of Stone a little dizzy. He had no doubt he could get up there. It was getting down that might pose a problem.</p>
			<p>"Are you sure you want to go up there alone?" asked Vakama. "I could-"</p>
			<p>"No," Onewa replied. "If I have to be concerned about me falling, I don't want to have to be worrying about you falling too. Besides, if I don't make it down..."</p>
			<p>Vakama nodded. Risking both Toa Metru would be foolish. Someone had to be left to get the Great Disk if Onewa failed.</p>
			<p>The Toa of Stone dug one of his proto pitons into the side of the sculpture and began to climb. Vakama, Ahkmou, and Nuhrii watched him as he slowly ascended, each alone with his thoughts.</p>
			<p>Onewa moved slowly, but steadily. His new body was far stronger than his Matoran form had been, but still his shoulders and arms already ached from the effort. And there was still so far to go.</p>
			<p>His thoughts drifted back to the Great Temple and the moment he and the others had become Toa. He had certainly never imagined, when he brought the Toa stone there, that his whole life was about to change. Nor would he necessarily have picked his five fellow heroes of Metru Nui. Vakama was too much of a dreamer, Nokama seemed a little stuck on herself, Matau was simply annoying, and Nuju and Whenua argued constantly.</p>
			<p>Still, they must have been chosen for this honor for a reason. Just as a Po-Metru crafter carefully selected the right tools for a job, so the Great Spirit Mata Nui must have had a plan in mind when he chose the six. But what it could be, Onewa had no idea.</p>
			<p>Then an awful thought struck him. What if they were not the Matoran meant to become Toa? What if there had been a mistake? An accident? What if one or more of them got Toa stones when they were not meant to do so? What would that mean for Metru Nui?</p>
			<p>The idea disturbed him so much that his hand slipped off his proto piton. He caught it, just barely, and decided to stop worrying about what might have been. Things were the way they were. If a crafter got handed a badly made tool to carve, well, he worked with what he was given. Onewa would have to do the same thing.</p>
			<p>He was nearing the top now and could see the Great Disk. Getting it out without bringing the slab of protodermis down on top of his head would take skill.</p>
			<p>Onewa planted one proto piton, tested to see if it was firm, and then let go of the other. He took hold of the Great Disk and gave it a tug, but it wouldn't budge. Another, and another, and still it wasn't going to move.</p>
			<p>The Toa of Stone saw only one chance. He was going to have to use both hands. He crawled as far up to the top of the sculpture as he could and let go of the piton. He grabbed the Great Disk with both hands and pulled with all his strength. It gave just a little. Then a little more. One more tug would do it-</p>
			<p>It was free!</p>
			<p>Onewa felt a split second of triumph. Then he realized the slab was teetering in his direction. That was the good news. He was also falling to the ground far, far below.</p>
			<p>Desperately, he reached out and grabbed one of his pitons. The force of his fall tore it loose from the sculpture, but at least now he had a tool. Now if only he could think of something to do with it.</p>
			<p>Down below, Vakama watched Onewa's fall with horror. None of his disks would help in this situation, and melting the slab wouldn't save the Toa of Stone. But there had to be some way his elemental power could help.</p>
			<p>Then he remembered something from his lifetime spent around heat and flame. He reached out with his Toa energy and began to heat the air beneath Onewa. Hot air would create an updraft that would slow the Toa's fall, Vakama was almost certain. It wouldn't save him, but it might buy him time to save himself.</p>
			<p>Onewa felt his fall slowing slightly as a blanket of warm air surrounded him. He didn't know if it was Vakama giving him this chance or something else, but he was determined not to waste it. He slung his proto piton and caught it on part of the sculpture, twisting his body so he would swing rather than just stop abruptly. The sudden deceleration still felt like it would tear his arm off, but his new Toa strength won out.</p>
			<p>He paused to catch his breath and make sure the Great Disk was safe. That's when the shadow fell on him. Onewa looked up to see the massive slab falling right toward him.</p>
			<p>He dove headfirst off the sculpture. He tossed his piton ahead of him, felt it catch the sculpture, and swung around and down. It was now only a short drop to the ground. Onewa hit the sand and rolled, grateful to be back on solid ground.</p>
			<p>Then the shadow came again, and he heard Vakama shouting, "Watch out!"</p>
			<p>The huge slab of protodermis crashed to the ground with a force that sent tremors throughout Po-Metru. When the cloud of sand finally cleared, there stood Onewa, unharmed. Miraculously, the portion of the "mountain" that had come down on him contained the hole that had housed the Great Disk.</p>
			<p>From his vantage point, Vakama smiled. Someday, if Onewa allowed it, this would be a wonderful tale to tell.</p>
			<h2>9</h2>
			<p>Vakama, Onewa, Nuhrii and Ahkmou were the first to make it back to the Great Temple. It was Onewa who spotted the squad of Ga-Metru Vahki circling the place.</p>
			<p>"What do you think? Could Nokama and Matau be in trouble?" asked Vakama.</p>
			<p>Onewa shook his head. "If they had taken two Toa Metru in, the Vahki wouldn't still be here. I'm guessing our friends slipped away and the Vahki are searching the area for them."</p>
			<p>"And the other Toa Metru could walk right into their claws. We have to lure them away from here. But what would make Vahki pass up the chance to capture two powerful strangers who appeared in their metru?"</p>
			<p>"How about six?" said Onewa, smiling.</p>
			<p>"Did I mention this was a bad idea?" asked Nuhrii, trying not to tremble.</p>
			<p>"At least eight times," answered Onewa. "It's simple. Just run up to the Vahki and say what we told you."</p>
			<p>"Why would they listen to a Ta-Matoran? This is Ga-Metru!"</p>
			<p>"Nuhrii, if a Rahi with a slime trail came up to them and told them where to find us, they would listen," said Onewa. "Don't worry. We'd send Ahkmou, but bad things tend to happen whenever he's out of my sight."</p>
			<p>"Remember, this isn't just about us," said Vakama. "It's for the sake of the whole city."</p>
			<p>The Ta-Matoran shrugged. "Yeah. So you keep saying."</p>
			<p>Nuhrii dashed out into the avenue and ran straight for the Great Temple. The Vahki immediately flew down and surrounded him. The Toa could not hear what the Matoran was saying, but if he stuck to the script, he was claiming to have seen six strangers on the other end of the metru. They were keeping Matoran from doing their work and generally causing trouble.</p>
			<p>As Onewa had expected, that was all the Vahki needed to hear. The Bordakh transformed from bipeds to four-legged creatures, their tools now serving as their front legs. Then they flew off in the direction Nuhrii had pointed. As soon as they were gone, the Ta-Matoran sank to his knees.</p>
			<p>Vakama ran over to him. "Good job, Nuhrii."</p>
			<p>"You owe me one," said Nuhrii. "You all owe me one."</p>
			<p>"Let's hope the city survives long enough for you to collect." Vakama turned at the familiar voice. Nokama was standing behind him with Whenua, Matau, and Nuju, and all were carrying Great Disks. A feeling of relief washed over him-in their first great test, the Toa Metru had succeeded.</p>
			<p>"We did as you asked," said Nuju.</p>
			<p>"We sought-found the Great Disks," added Matau. "Now what?"</p>
			<p>"Tell us how to save the city," said Whenua.</p>
			<p>"Ummmm...well..." Vakama began. His visions had only shown that the Great Disks were needed to stop the destruction of Metru Nui. The "how" of it had never been revealed.</p>
			<p>"Come on, fire-spitter, this was all your idea," snapped Onewa. "We chased all over the city for these things. What are we supposed to do with them?"</p>
			<p>"We are supposed to act like Toa," said Nokama. "Vakama put us on the right path. Now we must all decide on the next step. Let us share what we know. Vhisola's researches confirmed what Vakama said-the six Great Disks, used together, can defeat the Morbuzakh. More, it seems there is a single root that is the center of this menace."</p>
			<p>"Ehrye showed me records in a Knowledge Tower that refer to a 'king root'," said Nuju. "It can be recognized by the brown stripe that runs up and down its length."</p>
			<p>"But where can it be?" asked Whenua. "It must be huge, to support so many vines over so much distance. Where could such a thing conceal itself?"</p>
			<p>"The Archives?" suggested Onewa. "You could hide a Bohrok swarm or three in that place, and still have room for a kolhii disk tournament."</p>
			<p>Whenua shook his head. "I'll admit there are a lot of unexplored places down there, but I think we would have noticed evil greenery. What do we know about this thing that might suggest a hiding place?"</p>
			<p>"It's strong. It's persistent," Vakama began. "It doesn't seem to like the cold, but thrives in heat. I've never seen anything else survive in a fire pit."</p>
			<p>"The Great Furnace," muttered Nuhrii. When the Toa all turned to look at him, he said, "Don't you see? If it loves the heat, what better place to hide?"</p>
			<p>"He's right," said the Toa of Fire. "Outside of the fire pits, which are too heavily guarded to provide sanctuary, the Great Furnace is the most significant source of heat in Ta-Metru. If it's driven Matoran away from the area, the Morbuzakh king root could easily conceal itself there."</p>
			<p>"Then our course of action is clear," said Nokama. "If there's a chance the root of this menace is in the Great Furnace, then it is to the Great Furnace we shall go. And Vakama will lead us."</p>
			<p>"Is that so knowing-wise?" asked Matau. "What makes him any better than the rest?"</p>
			<p>Nokama started to answer, but Vakama cut her off. "I'm not interested in being a leader. All I care about is saving the city. Ta-Metru is my home, and I know it better than any of you, so maybe Nokama's right in saying I should be in charge. After we defeat the Morbuzakh, you can all do as you like."</p>
			<p>"Too much talking," said Nuju. "Not enough doing. Let's get this over with."</p>
			<p>"Any special reason for your hurry?" asked Onewa.</p>
			<p>"I hate plants," answered Nuju, as he walked away.</p>
			<p>Over their strong objections, the Matoran were going along on the journey to Ta-Metru. Matau had joked that their job would be to keep the king root busy while the Toa waited for the right moment. He assured them that the moment would surely come while at least a few of them were still on their feet. It took Nokama some time to calm them down after that, and she firmly asked Matau to please keep his jokes to himself.</p>
			<p>They were traveling along back paths through the city. By now, the Vahki in all six metru had been stirred up and would be watching the chutes. Whenua commented that it was too bad they couldn't change back into Matoran at will, if only to be able to sneak around more effectively.</p>
			<p>"You can go back to being a Matoran if you want," Matau had replied. "I like being a Toa-hero!"</p>
			<p>By the time they reached the borders of Ga-Metru, Vhisola was looking over her shoulder every few seconds. While the Toa were scanning the air for signs of Vahki, her eyes were fixed on the ground, the shadowy alleys, and anywhere else from which danger might spring.</p>
			<p>"What's the matter, Vhisola?" asked Nokama. "You are with six Toa. You will be safe."</p>
			<p>"No, I won't," she whispered. "Neither will you, any of you. Don't you know what they say about Morbuzakh vines?"</p>
			<p>"Tell me."</p>
			<p>"When the Morbuzakh knows you are looking for it-" Vhisola paused and looked around again. Then, in a whisper so soft Nokama could barely hear, she said:</p>
			<p>"It comes looking for you."</p>
			<h2>10</h2>
			<p>Just across the northern border of Ta-Metru lay a nearly deserted neighborhood. It had been the site of the first appearances by the Morbuzakh vines. Countless Matoran had disappeared from there, many more had fled for their lives deeper into the metru. Since they entered the area, Vakama had not spoken a word.</p>
			<p>"I do not like this place," said Matau, looking around. "It feels cold-dead."</p>
			<p>"Where are all the Matoran?" asked Nokama.</p>
			<p>"If Ta-Metru is anything like Po-Metru, they are living now with friends or co-workers," answered Onewa. "Some insist on staying near the Vahki hives, believing it to be safer there. If they work near the outskirts, they're careful not to travel alone. Every few moments, they stop working to listen for the approach of a vine."</p>
			<p>Whenua frowned. "There was nothing in the past history of Metru Nui to hint such a crisis might occur."</p>
			<p>"But something like it was bound to happen," said Nuju. "We relied too much on others to protect us-Toa, Vahki, even Turaga Dume. When something happened they could not handle, all the Matoran could do was run. I could have predicted this."</p>
			<p>"Then why didn't you?" asked Vakama, gesturing at the abandoned buildings all around. "Why didn't anyone?"</p>
			<p>"I predict we better find a place to hide," broke in Onewa. "There's a Vahki squad up ahead."</p>
			<p>"This way." Vakama led his fellow Toa Metru and the six Matoran into a narrow alleyway. Using his flame power, he melted the lock on an old door and shepherded them inside the building.</p>
			<p>The heat struck the Toa like a fist. Although no Matoran seemed to be present in the forge, fires still leaped high and smoke made it hard to breathe. Tools were scattered about at the work stations and some items had even been left to melt in the flames.</p>
			<p>"They left in a hurry," said Whenua. "Maybe we should do the same."</p>
			<p>The Toa of Ice felt something strike his armor and bounce off. It made a sharp sound when it hit, as if it were a pebble. When it happened a second time, Nuju said, "What is that?"</p>
			<p>Nokama's keen eyes had spotted where the second object landed. She bent down and scooped it up. It was a round object, roughly a quarter of the diameter of a Kanoka disk. Its outer shell was pitted, extremely hard, and the colors of fire. "It looks like some kind of...seed."</p>
			<p>Another fell, and then another. That's when the full impact of what she had just said became clear to her. She looked up at the ceiling. It was covered in seeds, which were beginning to fall at a rapid pace. "Oh, Mata Nui protect us," she whispered. "Morbuzakh seeds! It must be!"</p>
			<p>Now the Toa Metru were caught in a downpour. When the seeds struck, tiny vines sprang forth from the shell and wrapped around whatever was closest, hanging on with an unnatural strength.</p>
			<p>"We have to get out of here!" Vakama shouted. He took two steps before black-brown tendrils wrapped around his legs, bringing him down hard. More seeds struck him, their vines binding him as effectively as chains. He could see the other Toa struggling, their arms pinned to their sides, their tools out fo reach, as more seeds rained down.</p>
			<p>The clatter of the shells striking the ground was deafening. Already, the stone floor was covered with a layer of rapidly germinating seeds. The little vines writhed like a nest of baby serpents, striking out to entangle the Toa. Nokama was in the worst shape, with vines covering her from neck to toe and reaching for her Mask of Power.</p>
			<p>None of the six Matoran had made it back out the door. They were pinned to the walls by tendrils, like insects caught in a blackened web.</p>
			<p>Vakama rolled across the floor, trying to find a sharp-edged fragment of protodermis he could use to saw through the vines. Whenua was on his feet, slamming his body against the wall, evidently trying to stun the plants into letting go.</p>
			<p>But it was Nuju who first managed to escape. Nokama's eyes widened as she saw him slice through the vines binding him with an icicle. In mere moments he was free and rushing over to help her. "We have to get the others out of here. Help me!"</p>
			<p>While Nuju hurried to untie the other Toa, Nokama used her hydro blades to free the Matoran. Then they all rushed out the door before the vines could grab hold again. Vakama slammed the door shut behind them, stamping on the vines as they tried to slip underneath. "Nuju! Onewa! Bring the building down!"</p>
			<p>Onewa called on his elemental energies as Nuju did the same. From one side of the building, a pillar of stone rose into the air. From the other, a pillar of ice took shape. Nodding to each other, both Toa released their control and sent the twin pillars crashing into the roof. Under the weight of rock and ice, the forge collapsed in on itself, burying the plants.</p>
			<p>Nokama felt a shudder run through her form. "Do you think that will stop them?"</p>
			<p>Vakama shook his head. "Maybe for a little while. You know what this means, don't you?"</p>
			<p>"It's reproducing," said Whenua, "and we have no idea how many other seeds might be waiting to sprout. Their roots will link up with the king root and the Morbuzakh will be everywhere."</p>
			<p>"It could overrun our city-home," Matau said quietly. "Too many vines to stop, too little time."</p>
			<p>Vakama checked to make sure his disk laucher was loaded. Then he turned to the group and said, "Let's go. We have a weed to pull."</p>
			<p>As they walked, Nokama turned to Nuju. "I appreciate your rescue. But how did you get free?"</p>
			<p>"I saw what the seeds were doing to the others," he said, his eyes looking straight ahead. "So when they began to strike me, I took a deep breath and expanded my chest. Then when I let the breath out, I had just enough slack to move a little. I didn't need my spikes to make something as simple as an icicle."</p>
			<p>"That's amazing!"</p>
			<p>Nuju shrugged. "I'm from Ko-Metru. We think ahead."</p>
			<p>The Great Furnace was not as big or imposing as the Coliseum in the center of Metru Nui. It did not have the feeling of power and mystery that Ga-Metru's Great Temple possessed. But every Ta-Matoran looked at it with awe and wonder. It was a symbol of what made the metru great-the power that turned solid protodermis to molten liquid, and the skill to shape that raw material into the tools Matoran used every day.</p>
			<p>Now Vakama stood outside the entrance, staring up at the reddish-black exterior, wondering just what was lurking in the heart of the flame.</p>
			<p>"So this is the plan?" asked Onewa in disbelief. "We knock on the front door and ask if the Morbuzakh can come out to play?"</p>
			<p>"I am not saying we should listen to all of Vhisola's fears," replied Nokama, making an effort to remain calm. "But if she is right-"</p>
			<p>"If she is right, then we are facing more than just a plant," said Matau. "It can think-plan. And it probably already knows we're here."</p>
			<p>"Then we won't keep it waiting," said Vakama. "Nuhrii, you and the other Matoran will accompany us inside, but stay back. There is no telling what we will encounter in there."</p>
			<p>"One of us should stay out here to run for help, if need be," offered Ahkmou. "I volunteer."</p>
			<p>"If we fail," said Onewa, "Metru Nui will be beyond help. Besides, you were so anxious to get the six Great Disks, Ahkmou, I think you should see them in action."</p>
			<p>The six Toa Metru looked at each other. The time for talking had passed. Each knew that the challenges they had faced so far could not compare with what they were about to attempt. No one needed to say that this might be the last adventure for one or more of them. Their goodbyes to each other were exchanged in silence.</p>
			<p>Vakama melted the lock on the massive door. With a final look at his friends, he opened the gateway to the Great Furnace.</p>
			<h2>11</h2>
			<p>Toa and Matoran entered the structure. Just inside the door was a small, bare chamber. Its purpose was to give Matoran a chance to prepare before they proceeded to the inferno inside, or give them a chance to rest after they had spent some time laboring in the furnace. Beyond this chamber was the outer ring, a buffer to keep the intense heat from reaching the outer walls of the building.</p>
			<p>Surprisingly, there was no sign of the Morbuzakh here. A moment of panic swept through Vakama. What if they had been wrong? What if the king root was not here?</p>
			<p><i>Then we find it, wherever it hides,</i> he said to himself. <i>There's no other choice.</i></p>
			<p>He grasped the handle of the door to the outer ring. Vakama could feel the heat through it. In his mind, he was prepared for almost anything on the other side of that door. But in his heart, he wondered if six new, still untried Toa Metru would have the power to prevail.</p>
			<p>Disk launcher ready, Vakama threw open the door and rushed inside. Dim lightstones cast an unsettling glow on the long, narrow chamber. The air was filled with a strange, soft sound that seemed to come from everywhere at once.</p>
			<p>"What is that?" asked Vakama. "It sounds like hissing."</p>
			<p>"No, not hissing," replied Nokama. "It's...whispering."</p>
			<p>The Toa Metru stopped dead and looked around. The stone floor of the chamber was broken in numerous places. Growing from the cracks were small, twisted plants, with buds that stank of rot. Close inspection showed the buds were pulsating.</p>
			<p>"It's them. The sounds are coming from them," Whenua said. "Are they-"</p>
			<p>Onewa stepped carefully, trying to avoid touching any of the plants. "Yes. They're young Morbuzakh. New vines growing to strangle the city."</p>
			<p>The whispering grew louder. The children of the Morbuzakh sensed that they were not alone. A few of the plants began to stir, as if in a breeze. Then more started moving as agitation spread throughout the outer ring.</p>
			<p>"We cannot allow these things to grow-thrive," said Matau.</p>
			<p>"Let's see how they like a touch of frost." Nuju lowered his crystal spikes and sprayed a fine mist of ice over the plants. As the Toa watched, the ice spread across the entire crop. The plants began to sag beneath the weight, their whispering growing louder, then fainter. Finally, all was silent.</p>
			<p>Nokama took a step forward and water splashed around her feet. "Nuju! The heat in here is melting your ice."</p>
			<p>"Then I'll make more," said the Toa of Ice. He poured more and more of his energy through his tools, creating layer after layer of frost on top of the plants. Each time the heat of the Great Furnace would melt the ice and the plants would begin to struggle again. Then Nuju would call on more of his power.</p>
			<p>The seesaw battle between Toa Metru and the flames of Ta-Metru went on for several long minutes. The other Toa could see that Nuju was weakening. He staggered and would have fallen if Matau had not caught him.</p>
			<p>"My power...almost gone..." gasped Nuju.</p>
			<p><i>This was a msitake,</i> thought Vakama. <i>Our true struggle is waiting beyond this chamber. We should have saved our power for that. But why would the Morbuzakh leave these young vines undefended?</i></p>
			<p>The Toa of Fire got his answer in the next moment. Wave after wave of thorns flew from the walls, knifing through the air at the Toa Metru. "Toa! Defend yourselves!" Vakama shouted, hurling firebursts to incinerate the projectiles.</p>
			<p>Whenua yelled as one of the thorns grazed his armor. He activated his earthshock drills and began shredding the thorns as they came close. Across the chamber, Matau was conjuring a wind funnel to blow the thorns away, while Nokama used her hydro blades to parry them. Onewa was having the most trouble, but he stood and let the thorns strike him to buy the Matoran time to seek shelter.</p>
			<p>The six Matoran had hit the ground and were scrambling through the melted ice toward the door. Nuhrii glanced up and saw that the hail of thorns was heaviest near the exit. "We'll never make it!"</p>
			<p>"We have to," said Ahkmou. "I'm not staying here!"</p>
			<p>"Be quiet, Ahkmou!" snapped Tehutti. "We might not be here if it weren't for you. I saw something in the Archives once that might help us. Everyone join hands!"</p>
			<p>The other five Matoran did as Tehutti asked. "Now concentrate," the Onu-Matoran said. "We have to focus on our unity. That means you too, Ahkmou!"</p>
			<p>At first, their efforts seemed to have no effect. Then a glow surrounded the six Matoran and their bodies grew hazy and indistinct. There was a sudden, bright burst of light, and when it faded, one Matoran stood where six had been before.</p>
			<p>"We are one," the being said in a voice that sounded like a combination of the six Matoran. "We are the Matoran Nui."</p>
			<p>The eyes of the merged being scanned the chamber. The Toa Metru were fighting for their lives against the thorn barrage, but making no progress. "We understand now," said the Matoran Nui. "No one Matoran's ambitions are more important than Metru Nui as a whole. We must aid the Toa."</p>
			<p>The Matoran Nui darted forward, moving so quickly it dodged the thorns. Then with one blow it demolished the door to the inner chamber. The Toa Metru turned at the noise to stare in amazement at the new being in their midst.</p>
			<p>"Go!" said the Matoran Nui. "Defeat the Morbuzakh and save the city! It is what you were meant to do!"</p>
			<p>Vakama had a million questions, but no time to ask any of them. He turned to the other Toa and shouted, "Follow me!"</p>
			<p>The six heroes of Metru Nui charged into the heart of the Great Furnace toward what might be their final conflict. The Matoran Nui watched them go, whispering, "Mata Nui protect you all."</p>
			<h2>12</h2>
			<p>Outside of the Great Furnace, the Matoran Nui split apart to become six Matoran again. They blinked and stumbled, drained from their experience. "That was incredible. The power!" said Ehrye.</p>
			<p>"Let's do it again," said Vhisola. "Think of all we could do for our city."</p>
			<p>Ahkmou shook his head and backed away. "No. No. No way. If you five want to risk your lives, go ahead, but count me out. I'm looking out for what's most important: me."</p>
			<p>"Then go," said Tehutti. "If unity, duty, and destiny mean nothing to you, run back to Po-Metru, Ahkmou."</p>
			<p>The Po-Matoran laughed. "We'll see each other again. Don't worry. And then we will see just whose destiny will win out."</p>
			<p>With that, Ahkmou turned and fled to the shadows.</p>
			<p>The Toa Metru stood in the midst of a nightmare.</p>
			<p>The massive inner chamber of the Great Furnace had been transformed into a sanctuary for the king root of the Morbuzakh. Dominating the room was a huge, thick, winding stalk that extended from the ground all the way to the rooftop. The winding stripe that ran down its length marked it as the source of the Morbuzakh plague.</p>
			<p>Branches extended all along the root, entwining themselves with the masonry of the walls and floors. The king root had truly become a part of the Great Furnace. The Toa Metru could imagine each of those branches extending beyond the furnace, with multiple vines sprouting from them to threaten Metru Nui.</p>
			<p>Waves and waves of intense heat washed over the Toa. Already Nuju and Whenua were beginning to weaken. Vakama turned to the Toa of Water, saying, "Nokama, you must use your power to try to keep us cool. Can you do it?"</p>
			<p>"I don't know," replied Nokama. "I will do my best."</p>
			<p>The Toa of Water concentrated, calling on her energies to condense the moisture in the air into a cooling mist. It was an enormous drain, with the heat taking its toll on her as well. She could not help but wonder how long her strength would hold out, and what would happen if she fell.</p>
			<p>Vakama felt overwhelmed. The king root was far bigger and more frightening than he had ever dreamed. How could six disks, even Great Disks, bring such a monstrosity down? But what choice did they have?</p>
			<p>"Ready the disks," he said. "We will strike together and-"</p>
			<p>"Noooo!" The voice cracked like lightning in the minds of the Toa. "You will not desssstroy the Morbuzakh!"</p>
			<p>"What? Who was that?" said Onewa, looking around.</p>
			<p>"It wasssss I!" the voice boomed again.</p>
			<p>"Mata Nui," whispered Nokama. "It's the Morbuzakh-it speaks!"</p>
			<p>"Yessss, I sssspeak. I ssspeak. I think. I feel. And Metru Nui sssshall be mine!"</p>
			<p>Vakama could see no eyes or mouth anywhere on the root. It was not truly speaking, the Toa were simply hearing its thoughts. Worse, they could sense its feelings-an overwhelming hunger to possess the city and drive away anything that was not Morbuzakh. There was more there as well, traces of another intelligence, but they were too vague for the Toa to comprehend.</p>
			<p>"My armssss extend to every part of thissss city," the Morbuzakh continued. "I am in the furnacesss, the canalsss, the chutesss. The Matoran live and work only because I choossse to let them. But if they anger me-"</p>
			<p>A vine suddenly shot out of the wall, wrapped around a pipe, and crushed it to dust. "Firsst, I will drive the Matoran away from the outskirtsss of the city, so they cannot essscape. Then I will claim this place as my own. Those who ssssurvive can ssserve the Morbuzakh, or perisssh."</p>
			<p>The full horror of what they were hearing struck the Toa then. This was no mere overgrown menace, like the wild Rahi beasts that sometimes appeared in the city. The Morbuzakh was intelligent, cunning, and evil beyond anything they had ever imagined. None of them doubted that, if allowed to spread unchecked, this thing would do what it promised. Metru Nui would fall and the Matoran would become slaves of the Morbuzakh, or worse.</p>
			<p>So shocked were the Toa Metru that none of them noticed a vine creeping up behind Whenua. It struck amazingly fast, ripping the Great Disk from the Toa's grasp and snaking up toward the ceiling. Whenua shouted and grabbed the vine, which lifted him high into the air.</p>
			<p>Nuju ran, leaped, and caught Whenua's legs. He, too, was yanked off his feet and up toward the ceiling. The Morbuzakh vine whipped around violently in an effort to shake the Toa off. "Hang on!" shouted Nuju.</p>
			<p>"Thanks! That was my plan!" said Whenua. "Did you come up here just to tell me that?"</p>
			<p>Down below, the vines had wrapped themselves around Vakama and Onewa, but Matau had proven too fast for them. The Toa of Air darted across the floor, heading straight for the king root. "Morbuzakh, meet a Toa-hero!"</p>
			<p>Before Matau's startled eyes, a new vine grew out of the root. Before he could change direction, the vine swatted him out of the air and sent him crashing into the wall.</p>
			<p>Nokama, still straining to maintain her power, watched as Vakama's fire and Onewa's stone failed to make the vines break their grip. Above, Nuju had called upon his ice power but it was too weak to free him and Whenua.</p>
			<p><i>This is all wrong,</i> she thought. <i>We are all fighting individual battles, instead of working as a team. There has to be a way to stop this thing!</i></p>
			<p>Ignoring the possible consequences, Nokama suddenly dropped her efforts to keep the Toa cool amid the awful heat. She fired a stream of water up toward the vine that held Whenua's Great Disk, shouting, "Nuju! Freeze this!"</p>
			<p>The Toa of Ice did as she asked, forming the curving stream of water into an ice hook. Reaching out and grabbing it, he used the ice to pull the end of the vine close. "Whenua! Now!"</p>
			<p>Whenua thrust his earthshock drill forward and sliced through the vine. The portion holding the Great Disk fell away and plunged toward the ground as the vine writhed.</p>
			<p>Nokama glanced at Matau, who had finally regained his feet. Her eyes met his and she knew he was ready. He raised his aero slicers and hurled a blast of air at the falling vine, blowing it toward Nokama. The Toa of Water caught it on the fly, tore the vine loose, and held the Great Disk up proudly.</p>
			<p>"Your first defeat, monster!" she shouted at the king root. "But hardly your last!"</p>
			<p>"You can delay me, but not defeat me!" The Morbuzakh's voice sounded like a swarm of metallic hornets. "I am a part of Metru Nui now. I am thisss city, and it isss me!"</p>
			<p>"Then we will tear you out by the roots, Morbuzakh!" Vakama shouted. "One way or another, your reign ends today!"</p>
			<p>The vine holding Vakama swung him close to the body of the king root. Vakama took the opportunity to toss fireballs at the Morbuzakh, but the plant simply absorbed them. "Yesssss," said the Morbuzakh. "More! Fire feedssss me!"</p>
			<p>Whenua looked down at Matau, who nodded. Then the Toa of Earth let go of the vine, sending Nuju and himself plummeting toward the ground. When they were midway through their fall, Matau sent two mighty gusts of wind toward them. The wind caught the two Toa and flung them across the chamber right at the vines holding Vakama and Onewa.</p>
			<p>Toa of Ice and Earth slammed into the vines. The impact freed the two trapped Toa, who dropped to the ground. They had no chance to rest, however-Morbuzakh vines were now coming from every side, trying to grab the Toa or their Great Disks.</p>
			<p>Now began a desperate struggle, for the Toa Metru were not facing just one powerful, if immobile, enemy. They were fighting the thousand "arms" of the Morbuzakh, each as strong as the last, which struck and then slithered away. Toa tools flashed. Fire, ice, water, stone, earth, and cyclones filled the air. But for every vine the Toa struck down, three more rose to take its place.</p>
			<p>Eventually, the Toa began to tire. Without extensive practice in controlling and rationing their elemental energies, their powers began to run low. Little by little, the vines drove them away from the king root, growing bolder as they sensed the Toa slowing down.</p>
			<p>"You cannot sssstop me," hissed the Morbuzakh. "You have not the ssstrength. That isss all right. Too weak to be heroesss, perhapsss, but you will ssstill make excellent ssslavesss."</p>
			<p>"He's right," said Vakama. "We can't win this way."</p>
			<p>Onewa drove off another vine and looked at the Toa of Fire in disbelief. "This was your idea, and now you're quitting? What kind of a Toa are you?"</p>
			<p>"Stop fighting," Vakama said flatly. "It's our only chance."</p>
			<p>"You have gone around the chute," said Matau. "We stop hard-fighting and the vines will overwhelm us and drag us to the-" The Toa of Air suddenly stopped and a broad smile appeared on his face. "For a fire-spitter, Vakama, sometimes you can be almost as quick-smart as a Le-Matoran."</p>
			<p>Vakama checked to make sure that all the Toa had their Great Disks in their hands. Then he shouted, "Now!" As one, they dropped their Toa tools and stopped struggling against the vines.</p>
			<p>At first, the Morbuzakh did not seem to know how to react. When the king root spoke in their minds, there was confusion in its tone. "You would not sssurrender. Thisss is sssome trick. My vinesss could crusssh you where you ssstand!"</p>
			<p>"Then do it," said Nokama. "Don't just talk about it."</p>
			<p>"Maybe when we are done here, we could transplant this thing to Ga-Metru," Whenua suggested. "You know, add it to the garden near the canals. Ga-Matoran could climb it and build root-houses."</p>
			<p>"As long as it stops speaking," said Nuju. "There is nothing I dislike more than a talkative shrub."</p>
			<p>"Do what you like, Morbuzakh," snapped Onewa. "I would rather be fed to the Great Furnace than live in a city run by an obnoxious, foul-smelling, overgrown pile of vegetable matter good for nothing but clogging canals."</p>
			<p>The Morbuzakh's bellow was so loud the Toa were sure their heads would split open. Six vines shot around and wrapped around the heroes' waists, hauling them through the air toward the king root. The pressure of the vines was tremendous, threatening to squeeze the air out of the Toa's lungs.</p>
			<p>"Before you ssserve, you will sssuffer!"</p>
			<p>Vakama held up his Great Disk as the other Toa did the same. "No, Morbuzakh. You have had your season. The time for the harvest has come!"</p>
			<p>Pure power flashed from the six Great Disks, blindingly bright bands of energy that twisted around each other. Lightning flashed wherever two bands touched, striking at the vines that reached for the Toa. Then the energies blended together, forming a sphere in mid-air that moved slowly and inexorably toward the Morbuzakh.</p>
			<p>Desperately, the Morbuzakh tried to escape its own end. It writhed, the sheer power of its vines pulling down the walls of the Great Furnace. Masonry rained down from the ceiling as the plant's upper branches tried to batter their way to freedom. Great blocks of protodermis crumbled and fell into the flames, consumed in an instant, and still the Morbuzakh struggled. It had truly become one with this fortress of fire, and now both were about to fall.</p>
			<p>Taking advantage of the distraction, the Toa fought their way free of the vines that imprisoned them. Vakama looked up and saw that power no longer flowed from his Great Disk, nor from any of the others. But the sphere still existed, growing larger and larger every moment.</p>
			<p>"Toa, we have to go! Now!" he shouted. "The Morbuzakh will bring the Great Furnace down upon us!"</p>
			<p>Then came a sound the Toa Metru would remember for the rest of their lives: the sound of the king root screaming.</p>
			<p>That put an end to any arguments there might have been. Instead, the Toa raced for the exit to the outer chamber, pausing only to pick up their tools. They did not stop running until they were far from the Great Furnace and the thing that had dwelled inside.</p>
			<p>Only Vakama dared to look back. Through the crumbling walls, he could see that the energy sphere now encompassed the king root. Its walls had sliced through the multitude of vines, the high branches, and the deep roots that anchored the Morbuzakh in the ground. All around, the plant growth that had menaced Metru Nui was writhing and crumbling to dust.</p>
			<p>The king root hung suspended in the air now, trapped within the energy sphere. Cut off from the ground below and from its branches and vines, the root could no longer draw energy from the fires of Ta-Metru or feed it to the rest of the plant. It was alive, but isolated, a creature once connected with all of Metru Nui and now utterly alone. Eventually, its howls of rage began to fade away in the minds of the Toa, replaced by the sound of their own thoughts.</p>
			<p>The Great Furnace was now nothing but rubble and flames. The sphere glowed amid the wreckage as the struggles of the king root ceased. Then, as suddenly as it had appeard, the energy was gone. The king root struck the ground with a resounding crash and then crumbled to nothing before the Toa of Fire's astounded eyes.</p>
			<p>	*	*	*</p>
			<p>All around the city, Matoran looked on in wonder as the Morbuzakh vines turned to dust. Soon, there would be no sign of the plant left, except for the damage it had done. But the defeat of the Morbuzakh would not bring back all the Matoran who had vanished since the vines had first appeared in Metru Nui.</p>
			<p>Back at the ruins of the Great Furnace, Nokama looked at Vakama. "Is it really over?"</p>
			<p>"Yes," said the Toa of Fire. "With the king root gone, the rest of the Morbuzakh should soon follow. We have passed our first test as Toa Metru."</p>
			<p>"Then why are we standing here?" asked Matau. "Let's bring these ever-powerful disks to the Coliseum and tell the world we are Toa-heroes!"</p>
			<p>The six Toa Metru looked at each other and smiled. Matau's idea sounded like a good one. After all, despite their differences, they had found the Great Disks, defeated the Morbuzakh, and saved their city. As they walked away from the site of their first great victory, they knew they were no longer the Matoran they had been...or even the new Toa they had become...</p>
			<p>They were heroes of Metru Nui.</p>
			<h2>Epilogue</h2>
			<p>Turaga Vakama rose, signaling that his tale had come to an end. Takanuva, the Toa of Light, stood as well, smiling. "What a wonderful story!" he said. "The six of you started out as Matoran, just like I did, and became heroes. I bet the whole city turned out to cheer for you!"</p>
			<p>Vakama chuckled. "You are attaching a happy ending to my tale, Takanuva, because you wish there to be one. But there is much more to tell."</p>
			<p>"You had a vision when you first became a Toa," said Tahu, Toa of Fire. "A vision of disaster. Did defeating the Morbuzakh spare the city from that terrible event?"</p>
			<p>"It spared the city from the Morbuzakh," said Turaga Vakama. "We believed that was enough. Our world was very simple, Tahu, with good on one side and evil on the other."</p>
			<p>"What's wrong with that?" asked Onua, Toa of Earth. "I mean, we Toa challenged the Rahi and many other threats to this island. We fought for justice and to defend the Matoran and their villages. We stood up for the light and defeated the darkness that rose against us."</p>
			<p>"You are very wise, Onua," said Vakama. "But you have only the wisdom of your experience. That is why you are here now-to gain the wisdom of mine."</p>
			<p>There was an uncomfortable silence, broken finally by Takanuva. "It's late. I suppose we should leave Turaga Vakama to his rest. There is another tale to tell, isn't there, Turaga?"</p>
			<p>"Oh, yes, Takanuva," said Vakama. <i>A dark one indeed,</i> he added to himself.</p>
			<p>The Toa departed, all but Gali, Toa of Water. She had always been sensitive to others' moods, and she could tell that Vakama was troubled. It was more than just confronting the memories of his past. It seemed as if there were some terrible secret he knew he must share, but dreaded doing so.</p>
			<p>"Why do you tell these tales, Turaga?" she asked softly. "Is it only to prepare us for the journey to Metru Nui, and what we may encounter there?"</p>
			<p>"You already know the answer," he said, "or you would not ask the question. No, there is a great difference between the Toa Nuva that you are, and the Toa Metru that we Turaga were long ago. Your enemies hide in the shadows, but you know they are there. They make no effort to hide the darkness in their hearts. For us, it was...different."</p>
			<p>"But you were strong," she said. "You triumphed. You had the three virtues to guide you-Unity, Duty, Destiny."</p>
			<p>"Yes, we six had done our duty, we believed," Vakama said, with a trace of sadness in his voice. "And we felt certain we had achieved our destiny. But our unity? That still remained to be forged in the fires of danger, far greater danger than we had known before."</p>
			<p>Vakama leaned on his firestaff. Not for the first time, Gali found it hard to believe that the Turaga had once been a mighty Toa Metru. "You see, Toa of Water, we believed that we knew all we needed to know to be heroes. We could challenge an enemy, outwit it, defeat it, save Matoran, even save a city. Oh, we still needed training in our powers and we still had to master our masks. But being a hero? There was nothing left for us to learn there, we felt sure."</p>
			<p>Vakama looked at Gali. She understood now that his eyes had seen a greater darkness than any Toa Nuva could comprehend. <i>What happened on Metru Nui?</i> she wondered.</p>
			<p>"We thought we knew it all. But we were wrong, Gali, so very wrong. Our true lessons were about to begin."</p>

			<h1>BIONICLE Adventures #3: The Darkness Below</h1>
			<h3>Greg Farshtey</h3>
			<h2>Introduction</h2>
			<p>Jaller paused from his labors for a moment and took a deep breath. He could not remember ever working harder than he had in the past few days. Ever since it had been announced that the Matoran were going to move from the island of Mata Nui to the island city of Metru Nui, villagers had been toiling day and night to build enough boats for the great journey.</p>
			<p>For Jaller and his friends, the nonstop work was welcome. Their home, Ta-Koro, had been destroyed in the battle to save the island from darkness, and they were living in the other villages until the time came to leave Mata Nui forever. Talk around the fires at night was about Metru Nui, what wonders they might find there, and how soon they would be able to leave for this new and mysterious place.</p>
			<p>"We'll never get to Metru Nui if the great Jaller keeps taking rest breaks."</p>
			<p>Jaller turned to see his friend Hahli smiling at him. The Ga-Matoran had recently been named the new Chronicler, and ever since she had been traveling from place to place gathering tales about Metru Nui. She hoped to be able to share the stories with the other Matoran during the long journey to come.</p>
			<p>"At least when I'm working, I'm <i>working</i>," replied Jaller good-naturedly. "You can't build a boat with a story, you know."</p>
			<p>"Maybe not, but it sure makes the sailing go faster. I'm heading to see Turaga Vakama. He's about to continue his tale of Metru Nui to the Toa. I am supposed to record it for the Wall of History we will build on the new island. Come with me?"</p>
			<p>Jaller thought about it. He probably should keep working, but he was already far ahead of all the others. It wouldn't do any harm to take a little time off.</p>
			<p>"Okay. Let's go," he said.</p>
			<p>The two of them set out for the Amaja Circle sandpit, the place where Turaga Vakama traditionally told his tales. After a short while, Jaller asked, "So is it true?"</p>
			<p>"Is what true?"</p>
			<p>"All the stories I have been hearing. How the Turaga were once Toa on Metru Nui; how they searched for six missing Matoran, but learned that one of the Matoran planned to betray the city; and how they gathered six Great Disks and used them to defeat a menace called the Morbuzakh."</p>
			<p>Hahli nodded. "Yes, it's all true. Amazing, isn't it? One moment, they were Matoran just like us, living and working in a great city. The next moment, they were Toa Metru with powers and Toa tools and everything!"</p>
			<p>Up ahead, they could see the seven Toa gathered around Turaga Vakama. The Turaga had already begun to speak. "It had been a difficult and dangerous mission, but we six Toa Metru had triumphed. Metru Nui had been saved from the Morbuzakh, and we were certain that we would be hailed as heroes. But we were about to face another test, one that would threaten to shatter our newfound unity."</p>
			<p>The Turaga of Fire turned his gaze to the night sky, but all present knew that his eyes were truly viewing images from the past. "Toa would challenge Toa in the darkness below the city, in a struggle that still lives in my nightmares."</p>
			<h2>1</h2>
			<p>The six Toa Metru walked through the streets of Ta-Metru, on their way to the Coliseum. For the first time since they had transformed from Matoran, they felt no need to travel by way of back alleys or to stay in the shadows. Even the presence of Vahki, Metru Nui's order enforcement squads, did not worry them. After all, they had just defeated the Morbuzakh plant that menaced the city. They were heroes!</p>
			<p>Better still, they had found the legendary Great Disks, which had been hidden in separate parts of the city. They had no doubt that these artifacts would be enough to convince the city's elder, Turaga Dume, and all the Matoran that here were new Toa capable of defeating any threat.</p>
			<p>"They will cheer-hail us in the Coliseum," said Matau, Toa of Air, with a grin. "Po-Metru carvers will make statues of us. Perhaps they will even rename the districts for us! 'Ma-Metru'-I like the ring-sound of that!"</p>
			<p>The other Toa laughed. Matau was exaggerating, of course, but certainly Turaga Dume would honor them in some way. Matoran all over the city would demand it.</p>
			<p>"With the Morbuzakh gone, maybe we won't have any dangers to face," offered Whenua, Toa of Earth. "Except for the occasional Rahi beast on the loose, Metru Nui is usually pretty peaceful."</p>
			<p>"Just rest on our reputations, huh, Whenua?" said Onewa, Toa of Stone. "Not me. Now that I'm a Toa Metru, I'm going to take advantage of it. The best tools, the best materials, mine for the asking-I'll build statues like you have never seen before!"</p>
			<p>"I will do many Toa-hero deeds," said Matau. "That way there will always be tales to tell about me. What about you, Nokama?"</p>
			<p>"Well, I'm not sure," replied the Toa of Water. "There are so many places to see and explore. What is it like under the sea? What lies beyond the sky? Where do all those strange creatures you see in the Onu-Metru Archives come from? Now I have the power to go wherever I please and learn those answers."</p>
			<p>Nuju, Toa of Ice, shrugged. "I don't feel any need to explore. I have more than enough to keep me busy in Ko-Metru. Now that I am a Toa, perhaps others will not be so quick to interrupt me when I am working."</p>
			<p>Only Vakama, Toa of Fire, had yet to speak. Of all the Toa Metru, he was the least comfortable with his new powers and the responsibilities that came with them. Still, when duty demanded it, he had risen to the occasion and led the Toa to victory. Nokama noticed his silence and asked, "What about you, Vakama? Surely you have some dream you want to realize now that you are a Toa?"</p>
			<p>"Not really," he answered. "I mean, I am glad we became Toa and were able to save the city. But...I would be just as happy to still be working at my forge in Ta-Metru. It was much simpler. I guess once a mask-maker, always a mask-maker."</p>
			<p>Onewa chuckled. "The fire-spitter wants to go back to being a Matoran. I don't think the transformation works in the opposite direction."</p>
			<p>"Yes, we are stuck being Toa-heroes," said Matau. "And so many worry-problems we have-how many bows to take? How many mask-sculptures in each metru? How big of a shelter-house for each of us?"</p>
			<p>"If you aren't happy being a Toa, Vakama, maybe we should choose a new leader," said Onewa. "I am sure I could do the job."</p>
			<p>"Or I!" said Matau. "Matau of Ma-Metru, leader of the Toa-heroes! Oh, I like that!"</p>
			<p>I never said I didn't want to be a Toa," Vakama said. "And I <i>never</i> said I wanted to be the leader. I did the job because I knew Ta-Metru better than any of you. If someone else wants to be leader, go ahead."</p>
			<p>Nokama looked at Vakama. She could tell that he was hurt by the things Onewa and Matau were saying, but he wasn't going to admit to it. As they walked, the other Toa Metru debated who was best qualified to lead the team. Onewa said it should be a creative thinker like him. Matau countered that a high-flyer was best qualified to plan strategy. Whenua said he would take the job if asked, then seemed disappointed when no one asked him.</p>
			<p>As for Nuju, the Toa of Ice summed up his feelings in a few words. "I don't care who leads us, as long as he doesn't expect me to follow."</p>
			<p>Nokama was about to put all four of them in their place when she saw a Matoran approaching at a run. He was from Onu-Metru, and the anxious look on his face said there was serious trouble somewhere.</p>
			<p>Whenua stepped forward to greet him. The Matoran's name was Nuparu, and he was not someone Whenua knew well. When other workers in the Archives were busy among the exhibits, Nuparu was off on his own tinkering. He was always trying to figure out how Gukko birds flew, how the great Muaka cat could stretch its neck to lunge at prey, and other questions that might seem trivial to others. Still, Nuparu leaving the Archives and hurrying into Ta-Metru was enough to catch the Toa of Earth's attention.</p>
			<p>"Toa! The Archives are in danger!" the Matoran shouted.</p>
			<p>"It's all right, Nuparu," said Whenua. "The Morbuzakh has been defeated. Everyone is safe."</p>
			<p>The Matoran shook his head frantically. "No, no, it's not the Morbuzakh. It's the sea! It's going to flood the Archives and destroy all of the exhibits!"</p>
			<p>Whenua wasn't sure how to react to the Matoran's words. The Onu-Metru digging machines, and the workers who operated them, took special care to make sure the outer walls of the Archives were reinforced. The deeper they dug to create new sublevels, the greater the pressure from the liquid protodermis outside. But the sea had never posed a serious threat to the existence of the exhibits in all of Metru Nui's recorded history.</p>
			<p>The Toa of Earth waved the other Toa Metru away. This was an Onu-Metru problem, and it would be solved by the guardian of that district, he decided. "Now tell me what you saw," he said to Nuparu.</p>
			<p>"I was down...um...below the sublevels, and-"</p>
			<p>"Wait a moment, what were you doing so far down? You know how risky it is to go there!" As soon as he said it, Whenua regretted the sharpness of his tone. But it had not been so long ago that he had been down in that dark and fearsome section, and he had barely escaped intact. No Onu-Matoran, archivist or not, had any business wandering among "exhibits" deemed too dangerous for display.</p>
			<p>"Well, I...I...I heard there was a Rahkshi down there, a yellow one, and it had been defeated, and I wanted to...well..."</p>
			<p>"You were hoping to scavenge some parts for your latest invention," Whenua finished for him, frowning. "You know what would happen if the other archivists caught you doing that? Or worse, a Vahki?"</p>
			<p>"I know," Nuparu said, looking down at his feet. "But I didn't find anything anyway. Then I saw a hatch in the floor and I went down through it. There was a whole maze of tunnels there I never knew existed! So I used my lightstone to explore. I didn't see very much, no exhibits or anything, but when I rounded a corner, I was suddenly walking in protodermis! The sea was leaking in!"</p>
			<p>Nuparu's voice was loud enough that the other Toa Metru could not help but hear. Nokama, in particular, was intrigued by the mention of the sea. She grew closer as the Matoran continued to talk.</p>
			<p>"So at first I didn't know what to think. I was going to turn back, but then I figured as long as I was down there, I'd better find out how serious the situation was. I found one whole wall had a huge crack and the sea was pouring right through it!"</p>
			<p>"How bad?"</p>
			<p>"The crack is spreading. If it's not repaired soon, the whole sea wall will breach," said Nuparu. "The sublevels will flood, then the lower levels, and pretty soon the whole Archives will be washed away."</p>
			<p>"But there is a repair crew headed down now, right?"</p>
			<p>Nuparu shook his head. "No one wants to go down there. They've all heard too many stories. That's why, when I heard there was a new Toa of Earth, I came looking for you. Someone has to do something!"</p>
			<p>"Someone will," replied Whenua. "Now tell me the story again. I want to hear every detail of what you saw, and where you saw it."</p>
			<p>Nokama had rejoined the others by the time Whenua was finished talking with the Matoran. The Toa of Earth looked grim as he walked over to the group.</p>
			<p>"I have to go," he said. "Someone will have to apologize to Turaga Dume for me, but this is an emergency. I'll meet you all at the Coliseum later on."</p>
			<p>"What could be more serious-matter than telling the world what we can do?" asked Matau.</p>
			<p>"Actually doing it," Nokama answered. "But you don't have to take on this task alone. I will come with you. The Archives are important to everyone in Metru Nui. I know anyone from Ga-Metru would do the same."</p>
			<p>"I'll come too," said Vakama. "My flame power is weak after the struggle with the Morbuzakh, but maybe I can help somehow." He turned to Onewa. "Can you three explain to Turaga Dume why we cannot present ourselves to him just yet?"</p>
			<p>"Oh, sure," Onewa snorted. "'The other three of us would be here, Turaga, but they're out being heroes while we stand around.' I say we <i>all</i> go, we <i>all</i> do the job, and then we <i>all</i> head to the Coliseum. What do you think? Matau? Nuju?"</p>
			<p>"The sooner we take care of this, the sooner I can get back to Ko-Metru," said Nuju. "I say we help Whenua."</p>
			<p>"Hmmmmmm," Matau said. "I was in a hurry to tell the Matoran we are Toa-heroes now. But I suppose repair-saving the Archives along with the whole city will be good for twice the celebration. On to Onu-Metru!"</p>
			<p>Their course of action agreed upon, the six changed direction and began journeying toward the metru of the archivists. Whenua led the way, still talking with Nuparu, while Nokama and Vakama brought up the rear. After a short while, the Toa of Water said, "You know, we cannot take a vote every time we have to decide something."</p>
			<p>"What's that?"</p>
			<p>"Just now. The protodermis could have risen another level in the time it took for each Toa to decide if he was coming along or not. We don't have the luxury of debating every point. We need a leader."</p>
			<p>"I'm sure you'll do a fine job," he said.</p>
			<p>"No, that's not what I-" Nokama began, but the Toa of Fire had already walked away.</p>
			<h2>2</h2>
			<p>Whenua led the Toa Metru to a desolate spot just inside the border of Onu-Metru. Most of the chutes and much of the aboveground structure of the Archives had been damaged by Morbuzakh vines, and Onu-Matoran were now hard at work doing repairs. All of them stopped their labors at the sight of the Toa and crowded around.</p>
			<p>Matau greeted them warmly and immediately launched into a tale of the Toa's heroic deeds. THe other Toa watched, amused, as he turned their clash with the Morbuzakh into an even greater adventure than it had been.</p>
			<p>"If he wasn't a Toa, he could apply to be Chronicler," Onewa said. "Is he ever quiet?"</p>
			<p>"Not that you would notice," said Nokama. "Whenua, I don't see an entrance to the Archives here. How will we get where we have to go?"</p>
			<p>"There's no entrance you can see," Whenua said. He walked down an alleyway and knelt beside an iron ring in the pavement. He grabbed the ring and, with a mighty heave, pulled open a trapdoor. Tiny winged Rahi and swarms of insects flew up, followed by a wave of damp, foul-smelling air.</p>
			<p>"Not very pleasant, I will agree, but it is a shortcut," Whenua said with a shrug. "According to Nuparu, the damage is in the maintenance tunnels. The nickname for them is 'Fikou web', after what the spiders leave down below, because the tunnels crisscross and twist around each other so."</p>
			<p>"What if one of us gets lost?" asked Nokama.</p>
			<p>"Don't," replied Whenua. "Just...don't. You wouldn't like it. The Matoran tell stories about repair crews that have been wandering down there since the early days of the Archives, unable to find their way out. They are supposed to have gone a little crazy. But, of course, those are just stories."</p>
			<p>None of the Toa looked especially comforted by this. Matau had finally finished his tale and came over carrying six lightstones. "Just in case it is night-dark down there."</p>
			<p>"Can I come?" asked Nuparu. "I can lead you right to the leak."</p>
			<p>"You've done enough already," said Whenua. "I want you to go warn the archivists about this. Tell them we are going to do our best to fix the damage, but they should prepare to move exhibits out of the sub-basements in case they flood. Understand?"</p>
			<p>Nuparu nodded and ran off. He understood why Whenua did not want him to come along, but it still frustrated him. As he rushed to carry out the Toa's instructions, he made a vow that someday he would invent something that would help Matoran better defend their homes from danger.</p>
			<p>Whenua turned back to his friends, saying, "Hopefully, this won't take long. But be careful. There are always surprises in the Archives."</p>
			<p>One by one, the Toa followed him down into the shaft. Only Matau seemed to hesitate, prompting Nokama to turn back and say, "What's the matter?"</p>
			<p>"I do not like the below-ground," answered the Toa of Air. "I am a wind-flyer. Toa-hero adventures should only be on the surface, don't you think?"</p>
			<p>"We can only hope," said Nokama as she vanished into the darkness.</p>
			<p>The maintenance tunnels were to the underground what chutes were to the rest of Metru Nui: a quick means of transport from one end of the city to the other. Unlike chutes, which served everyone in Metru Nui, the tunnels were open only to those with authorization, normally Ta-Matoran and Onu-Matoran. Pipes big and small lined the walls of the tunnels, funneling liquid protodermis from place to place and molten protodermis to those locations that required extra heat.</p>
			<p>Ordinarily, Matoran traveled through these tunnels by cart. But Matoran carts were too small for Toa Metru. Whenua idly wondered if the Toa should see about getting vehicles made for them in the future. Might save a lot of walking, swinging, and climbing.</p>
			<p>The Toa of Earth felt uneasy. He knew the other Toa Metru were expecting him to take the lead on this mission, but his knowledge of the Fikou web was based largely on stories he had heard. He had never had cause to go much farther than the very outer edges of the tunnel network, and even that was with reluctance.</p>
			<p>He was still worrying over this when he felt a cold breeze rush past him. It had come from deep in the maze, which made no sense-there should have been no openings to the outside up ahead. The only hatchways led up to the Archives, and certainly no breeze could come from there.</p>
			<p>None of the other Toa seemed particularly disturbed by the strange wind or the drop in temperature. Whenua guessed they just didn't grasp the strangeness of the situation. He suddenly felt as if he could not take another step forward. Something was waiting up ahead, something far worse than any crack in the seawall, and they were walking right into its jaws. He just knew it.</p>
			<p>His suspicions were confirmed a few moments later when a thick fog sprang from nowhere to engulf the Toa. Even their lightstones were of little use in penetrating the cloud. Whenua turned to find he could not make out any of his companions.</p>
			<p>"Vakama? Nuju? Are you there?" he called out.</p>
			<p>"Yes. What is this?" Vakama replied.</p>
			<p>"I have never seen fog like this, not even in Ga-Metru," Nokama's voice added. "It is unnatural."</p>
			<p>Just how unnatural it was became painfully obvious. A sudden flash of light almost blinded the Toa. An instant later, an impact sent Whenua crashing into his friends. Barely clinging to consciousness, the Toa of Earth said, "What in the name of Mata Nui was that?"</p>
			<p>"A lightning bolt," answered Onewa. "A lightning bolt in an enclosed tunnel underground. Is this normal in Onu-Metru, or are we just lucky?"</p>
			<p>As if the freak storm had heard him, a second bolt flew toward the Toa of Stone. Acting on reflex, Onewa dove to the side as the bolt struck the wall where he had been.</p>
			<p>"That was no accident," said Nokama. "Perhaps it's time we turned back and planned a strategy."</p>
			<p>Nuju's voice broke through the fog. "If we could see where we are going, I would agree. As it is, I don't think we should turn our backs on an angry thundercloud."</p>
			<p>"Quiet!" said Vakama. "Listen!"</p>
			<p>The Toa Metru went silent. Now the air was filled with an ominous buzzing sound, which drew closer and closer. Not being able to see what caused it made it all the more frightening. "All right, keep calm," said Vakama. "Remember that we are Toa Metru, and we are together. As long as we stay united, we can overcome anything."</p>
			<p>Privately, Vakama was not feeling quite so confident. He thought he recognized that sound. If he was right, it came from a breed of Ta-Metru winged insects, nicknamed "fireflyers". Left alone, the small insects were relatively harmless. But when a swarm was angered, they would pursue an enemy halfway across the city.</p>
			<p>Behind him, Matau had finally had enough. Bad enough to be wandering underground without all this danger and confusion. He raised his aero slicers and summoned a wind to blow the fog away. Although the best his weakened powers could manage was a stiff breeze, it was still enough to get the job done.</p>
			<p>The fog dissipated, to reveal a sight out of every Matoran's nightmare: two powerful, menacing creatures, reptilianlike heads darting back and forth, staffs held tightly in their claws.</p>
			<p>"Rahkshi!" shouted Whenua.</p>
			<p>One of the Rahkshi was gold in color and now it screeched at the Toa. This Rahkshi had the ability to manipulate the weather within a limited range. Its partner, bright orange in color, was surrounded by a swarm of fireflyers. Controlled by the Rahkshi, the insects were just waiting for the signal to charge.</p>
			<p>"What are they doing here?" asked Nokama.</p>
			<p>"A better question is, what are we doing here?" said Onewa. "It took three squads of Vahki Zadakh to stop one Rahkshi that appeared in Po-Metru, and even then all they could do was drive the thing away."</p>
			<p>"Then we will have to do better," said Nuju, blasting ice out of his crystal spikes. But his powers were not what they had been before the clash with the Morbuzakh, and the Rahkshi shrugged off the cold. The gold one hissed and unleashed a blizzard in the direction of the Toa.</p>
			<p>Battered by wind and ice, the heroes fell back. Only Vakama saw the advantage they had gained-the intense cold was felling the fireflyers one by one. Angered, the orange Rahkshi was now advancing on the gold one.</p>
			<p>Now the Toa were witness to a scene of complete chaos. The gold Rahkshi had summoned another storm and was hurling lightning bolt after lightning bolt at its insect-controlling cousin. What it did not realize was that a swarm of tiny devourers was pouring forth from every crack in the walls and floors. Devourers would consume any bit of inorganic protodermis they ran across. Rahkshi armor was definitely on their menu-and all of them were hungry.</p>
			<p>"This would be really entertaining if we didn't have to get past them to go on," said Onewa. "Whenua, you're the librarian, what do you know about these things?"</p>
			<p>The Toa of Earth had by now shaken off the lightning strike and regained his feet. "Rahkshi are very territorial and quick to anger. If we make a move toward them, they'll forget their own fight and turn on us again."</p>
			<p>"But this isn't about us, is it?" said Nokama. "They have claimed this portion of the tunnel as their own and they are defending it."</p>
			<p>"Then that is the answer," said Nuju. "We make it not worth the effort to defend. Vakama, Whenua, I will need your help."</p>
			<p>Nuju outlined his plan in as few words as possible. The Rahkshi's clash was becoming even wilder, threatening to bring the tunnel down around them. When the Toa of Ice nodded his head, Vakama placed his palms on the floor and sent waves of scorching heat through the stone. Meanwhile, Nuju used the remains of his elemental power to create icicles on the roof of the tunnel.</p>
			<p>Just as the Rahkshi took notice of the heat underfoot, Whenua went to work with his earthshock drills. Driving them into the ground, he formed a crevasse that ran straight toward the Rahkshi. Both of the creatures had figured out the Toa were somehow responsible for the sudden change in conditions, and they were not happy about it.</p>
			<p>Nuju's plan had worked halfway. The Rahkshi were definitely uncomfortable, but not rattled enough to flee from their chosen home. Vakama loaded a disk in his launcher and hurled it through the air at the gold Rahkshi. When it struck, the enlarging power invested in the disk caused the Rahkshi to shoot up rapidly, smashing its head into the ceiling and bringing icicles raining down.</p>
			<p>The insect-controlling Rahkshi did not react as Vakama hoped. Instead of fleeing into the darkness of the tunnels, it charged forward toward the Toa. Nokama and Vakama reacted as one, he launching fire and she water at the oncoming creature. But when their energy streams collided, the result was a wall of steam. By the time the cloud cleared away, the Rahkshi was nowhere to be seen.</p>
			<p>"Somehow I don't think a steam bath frightened it away," said Nuju. "It will be back."</p>
			<p>"Mata Nui! Why don't you watch what you're doing?" Nokama snapped at the Toa of Fire. "I might have stopped it if you hadn't gotten in the way."</p>
			<p>"I got in the way? That wasn't how it looked from here."</p>
			<p>Nokama was about to say something else when she changed her mind. Arguing wasn't going to make anything better. "I'm sorry, Vakama. Neither of us was at fault. But this is exactly why I have been saying we need leadership. We cannot keep blundering through challenges without any strategy."</p>
			<p>"Here's a strategy," said Onewa. "Let's stop talking and start moving, before we get any more surprises."</p>
			<p>The Toa Metru resumed their journey into the tunnels. None of them noticed another pair of eyes watching them, eyes far more observant than any Rahkshi's could be. They noted the way each Toa moved and fought, filing the information away for later use. Then the owner of those eyes slipped away into the darkness without making a sound.</p>
			<p>The hunt had begun.</p>
			<h2>3</h2>
			<p>The Toa Metru did not encounter any more difficulties as they penetrated the outer edges of the maintenance tunnels. Now and then a small Rahi would skitter across their path, only to vanish down a hole or among the pipes. As they moved deeper into the maze, the air grew increasingly stale. Matau wondered aloud how Onu-Matoran could stand to work down here.</p>
			<p>"Practice," said Whenua. "Most Onu-Matoran start out as miners, digging for lightstones. You get used to the dark pretty quickly. If you're lucky, you get the opportunity to become an archivist, but even then you are indoors and underground much of the time. These tunnels might be a little extreme, but nothing an Onu-Matoran can't handle."</p>
			<p>Onewa looked around. "I don't see any Matoran though."</p>
			<p>"Well...see...some of the ones who have come down here in the past sort of...haven't come back."</p>
			<p>"You said that was a legend," said Nokama.</p>
			<p>"Evidently, Onu-Matoran legend has a basis in fact," muttered Nuju.</p>
			<p>"Anything else you forgot to tell us, Whenua?" asked Onewa.</p>
			<p>Whenua raised his lightstone to give the Toa Metru a good look at what lay ahead. "Just that."</p>
			<p>The wide tunnel they were walking through came to an abrupt end at a stone wall a few paces away. Six narrow openings were visible in the wall, barely more than slits in the rock. "This is the start of the Fikou web," said Whenua. "From here, it's just narrow tunnels drilled into the rock, crisscrossing with each other, until we reach the main tunnel on the other side."</p>
			<p>"Do we split up?" asked Vakama.</p>
			<p>Whenua nodded. "The major crack in the seawall is on the other side of the web, but there could be damage closer to us as well. Each of us should take a tunnel. We'll see each other as we go, I'm sure, and then we can all meet up on the other side. Hang on to your lightstones. If you lose them, you might become a permanent resident down here."</p>
			<p>"That's what I like about Onu-Matoran," said Matau. "They are always so full of happy-cheer."</p>
			<p>Nokama chose the left-most tunnel. The passage was so narrow that it would have been impossible for two Toa to walk abreast. For one used to the freedom of the protodermis canals and the open sea, this space was far too cramped to be comfortable. She could well believe Matoran could go mad from too much time down here.</p>
			<p>Not for the first time, she wondered if becoming a Toa Metru had been such a good thing. So far, she did not seem to get along very well with any of her comrades. They were certainly not the five she would have chosen as companions. Only Vakama had struck her as possessing real wisdom behind his shy front, and now she had fought with him, too. She knew he had it in him to be a leader. Why wouldn't he recognize it?</p>
			<p>Nokama forced herself to get back to the job at hand. Using the lightstone, she examined every bit of the walls on either side, looking for cracks or leaks. One of these tunnels could flood in an instant, and while she could probably survive that, she wasn't so sure about the other Toa Metru. She hoped they were being careful.</p>
			<p>The tunnel wound around and around like the body of a serpent. Smaller passages broke off to the left and right, usually dead-ending rapidly. Still, each of them had to be examined. She wondered how Whenua could have even considered doing this job on his own-it would have taken forever!</p>
			<p>After a while, Nokama started to grow bored. One tunnel looked just like the other, and none of them showed any signs of damage. She wondered if this might be just a wild Rahi chase. Some Matoran thought he saw something, panicked, and ran for the nearest Toa. Back when she was teaching in Ga-Metru, she made a point of telling her students to always make sure of their facts before they spread a tale.</p>
			<p>She rounded a corner, expecting to see the same dull stone walls she had seen a hundred times before. Instead, she froze at the sight of the orange Rahkshi standing in the middle of the corridor. Its armored head was open, but no sound came form the creature.</p>
			<p>Nokama readied her hydro blades. The Rahkshi simply stared at her. Neither seemed to want to make the first move.</p>
			<p>The Toa of Water considered her options. If she advanced, she would surely have to challenge the Rahkshi and might or might not win. If she retreated, the Rahkshi might see it as a sign of weakness and pursue.</p>
			<p>While Nokama was making up her mind, the Rahkshi raised its staff and pointed it at her. A swarm of fireflyers appeared from the darkness and flew straight for her. Even as she braced for their stings, Nokama wondered why the Rahkshi looked so surprised at the display of its own power. The creature was actually backing away, as if afraid of what it had unleashed.</p>
			<p>Not that its sudden show of regret did anything to help the Toa of Water. The insects were already swarming around her, stinging and then flying away, only to return and sting again. Nokama's armored body was enough to blunt most of their stings, but enough got through to drive her to the ground. As soon as she was subdued, the fireflyers left, their orders fulfilled.</p>
			<p>Only the Rahkshi remained, standing over the unconscious form of a Toa.</p>
			<p>In another tunnel, Vakama was wrestling with his thoughts. Despite some of the things she had said, he felt sure Nokama was truly his friend. She even seemed to think he should be the leader of the Toa Metru. True, he had done a decent job at that during the confrontation with the Morbuzakh, but he wasn't at all sure he would want the role permanently.</p>
			<p><i>I might look like a Toa...even act like one sometimes...but at heart, I am still a mask-maker,</i> he said to himself. His whole life had been spent working alone at his forge, crafting protodermis into Matoran masks and Masks of Power. It required patience, skill, and dedication, but it did not seem like the ideal job to prepare someone to lead Toa.</p>
			<p><i>This has all happened too fast,</i> he thought. <i>I went from being an average Matoran to suddenly having all these new powers and responsibilities. Others look at me differently, expect more from me.</i></p>
			<p>He paused to shine his lightstone on the wall. The rock was unmarred by any crack and looked like it had not changed in an eternity. <i>So why did I have to change?</i> he wondered. <i>Am I still Vakama? Or am I only the Toa of Fire now?</i></p>
			<p>He walked on, lost in thought. His eyes inspected the tunnel as he traveled, but his mind was back in Ta-Metru. For a moment, he wondered if it would ever be possible to go back to being a Matoran. But no, the legends said nothing about such a thing. A Toa was a Toa until he fulfilled his destiny, and then...what?</p>
			<p>So caught up was he in his questions that at first, he did not hear the footsteps ahead of him. When he finally did, he stopped...and so did they. When he resumed walking, the footsteps started again. Vakama wanted to call out and see if it was another Toa Metru, but then realized it might be a Rahkshi instead. No point in giving away his position if it wasn't necessary.</p>
			<p>He moved forward cautiously. The Toa had been caught by surprise a few times too often since their transformation. He was determined that it would not happen again.</p>
			<p>Disk launcher primed and ready, Vakama took a deep breath and charged around the bend in the tunnel. Yes, there was a figure up ahead. Lean, powerful, carrying some kind of wickedly sharp tools, it moved silently through the shadows. Then it stepped out into the light to reveal-</p>
			<p>"Nokama?" Vakama looked at the Toa of Water, stunned. They had just parted a short time ago. Had her tunnel crisscrossed with his so quickly? "Have you spotted anything, or not?"</p>
			<p>The Toa of Water shook her head slowly. "Not."</p>
			<p>Vakama moved closer to her, only to see Nokama step back. "What's the matter? It's just me. No reason for you to be afraid."</p>
			<p>"Not afraid," Nokama replied. "Have you spotted anything?"</p>
			<p>"Well, some little Rahi, some cart tracks, and a few Matoran names scrawled on the walls," said Vakama. "Nothing I would worry about."</p>
			<p>"Matoran," Nokama repeated quietly, almost as if it were a curse. "Well, I would worry."</p>
			<p>Vakama walked up to Nokama. She looked troubled. "What is it? Did you-?"</p>
			<p>The Toa of Fire stopped in mid-sentence. He was having another one of his visions, sudden flashes of the future like the one that had warned him about the Morbuzakh. He saw Toa Onewa lying on the ground, unconscious, and standing over him was...Vakama!</p>
			<p>A blast of water shattered the vision into a thousand pieces as the Toa of Fire went flying down the tunnel. He crashed hard into the stone wall and hit the floor. Before he could gather his wits and get up again, Nokama had him pinned with the force of her water bursts. Even as his body struggled to get free, his mind struggled with questions. Why was she doing this? How had her elemental energies been restored to full power? Was Nokama planning to betray the other Toa Metru, and if so, for what purpose?</p>
			<p>Vakama hoped to ask the Toa of Water these questions, if he was ever able to take another breath. But driven to the ground by the sheer, raw power of twin jets of water, it seemed more likely that he was about to become the first Toa to ever drown on dry land.</p>
			<h2>4</h2>
			<p>The gold Rahkshi moved carefully down the tunnel. Every one of its senses was on the alert. There were still intruders in its territory, and that was very bad. Intruders made loud noises and tried to drive the Rahkshi away, unless the Rahkshi struck first.</p>
			<p>It could not hear the six from before, but it could smell them. They were no longer together and their scent carried traces of fear. That was pleasing to the Rahkshi. When the ones from up above carried fear into the tunnels, they were easier to find and easier to drive off.</p>
			<p>The Rahkshi tried hard to remember how it had come to live in this place. But it could not. It had a vague memory of once living someplace else, then a long journey to the land above. But there were too many others there who tried to capture it. The Rahkshi escaped and fled down, down into the cold, welcoming dark.</p>
			<p>The creature paused as it sensed another presence up ahead. Another Rahkshi, but not a threat. It stayed close to the wall as it moved forward until the other came into view. It was the orange Rahkshi from before, but now it was stretched out on the ground and not moving.</p>
			<p>The gold Rahkshi crept closer. Why was the other so still? Was it hurt? Had the cold sleep overtaken it? No, the wormlike kraata inside was only stunned. Still, it wondered what could strike down a Rahkshi like this. Not one of the little ones from above. Not one of the six.</p>
			<p>Wait! There was a scent in the air, strong and not familiar to the Rahkshi. It had encountered a creature before with this scent, long ago when it first came to the tunnels. It sifted through dim memories trying to bring the image of the creature into focus.</p>
			<p>Then suddenly the Rahkshi remembered it all. And with the memory came something else, something none of its kind had ever felt before...</p>
			<p>Fear.</p>
			<p>Onewa pulled himself painfully up to his hands and knees. He wasn't sure how long the world had been black, or exactly how he had wound up on the tunnel floor, unconscious.</p>
			<p>The sight of scorch marks on the stone wall started bringing it all back to him. He had been exploring the tunnel when someone came up behind him. It was Vakama. The Toa of Fire seemed distracted, but he agreed to help Onewa check out some of the side passages. The Toa of Stone went back to work and then...</p>
			<p><i>He did it!</i> Onewa realized. <i>I felt the heat, and then the next thing I knew stalactites were falling down all around me.</i></p>
			<p>The Toa of Stone glanced up, already knowing what he would see. The stalactites had not broken off naturally-well-placed fire bursts had melted them free from the ceiling.</p>
			<p>Onewa didn't know why a fellow Toa Metru would try to harm him, and he didn't really care. All that mattered was finding Vakama and showing him just what stone could do against fire.</p>
			<p>In another tunnel not far away, Nokama too was awakening. She still ached from the fireflyer stings, but it was nothing she couldn't survive. No, she had something far more important to worry about.</p>
			<p>In her mind, she went over every detail of her encounter with the insect-controlling Rahkshi. She recalled its ever movement, its reaction to her, the way its armored head had opened to allow the kraata inside to screech.</p>
			<p><i>But it never made a sound,</i> she realized. <i>When the armored plates opened...there was no kraata inside!</i></p>
			<p>Nokama was no Rahkshi expert. She had seen them in stasis tubes in the Archives, like any other Matoran, and one of them had run amok once in Ga-Metru before the Vahki brought it down. But she knew enough to be certain that a Rahkshi without its kraata was just an empty, if still frightening, suit of armor.</p>
			<p><i>So that wasn't a Rahkshi,</i> she thought grimly. <i>Not unless they grow them differently down here. I'd almost think I had imagined the whole thing, but the stings are real. It was something that</i> looked <i>like a Rahkshi, had the powers of one, and...</i></p>
			<p>Once, a long time before, Nokama and some of her friends had been playing near the canals on the border of Ga-Metru and Ko-Metru. Nokama had slipped and fallen in. The current had swept her into the other metru. The liquid protodermis had turned frigid when it traveled through Ko-Metru, and by the time she was rescued, she was half frozen. But that chill was nothing compared to what ran through her now.</p>
			<p><i>If it can look like a Rahkshi, what else can it look like?</i> she asked herself, already breaking into a run. <i>Or...</i> who <i>else?</i></p>
			<p>Vakama was furious.</p>
			<p>He had awakened to find Nokama gone. Apparently, the Toa of Water thought she had finished him off. He was on his way to prove her very wrong.</p>
			<p>Toa Nuju had been walking for a very long time. At least, it seemed that way. As much as he disliked agreeing with Matau on anything, he was no more comfortable underground than was the Toa of Air. He missed the spires of Ko-Metru, the clean, crisp air, and most of all, the sight of the stars streaking by overhead. He belonged atop a Knowledge Tower, keeping watch over his metru, not wandering around Onu-Metru maintenance tunnels looking for leaks. Really, was this work for a Toa Metru?</p>
			<p>Still, at least these narrow passages gave him an excuse to get away from the other Toa. If he had to listen to more arguing, or another one of Matau's bad jokes, he was going to freeze the whole lot of them. Maybe after they presented themselves to Turaga Dume at the Coliseum, he could go his own way and simply be the Toa of Ko-Metru.</p>
			<p>His planning for the future was interrupted by a tremor that shook the entire tunnel network. This was followed by what sounded like a rock slide not far ahead. Images of the whole place coming down and trapping the six Toa Metru flashed through his mind. Nuju raced ahead, hoping he was wrong about what he had heard.</p>
			<p>It was almost worse than he had expected. A whole portion of one of the walls had collapsed, and the glow from the lightstone revealed Matau half buried in stone. Nuju tried to freeze the rocks, with the idea of shattering them once frozen, but his power was too weak. Instead, he had to remove them one by one as he dug out the Toa of Air.</p>
			<p>Matau revived just as Nuju finished. His eyes sparked to life and he hurled a mini-cyclone at Nuju. The Toa of Ice was blown back, but not hard enough to injure himself. "What was that for?" he demanded.</p>
			<p>"Nuju? Is that you?" asked Matau.</p>
			<p>"How many Toa of Ice do you think are walking around down here?" Nuju said, giving Matau a hand up. "What happened to you?"</p>
			<p>"Onewa," said Matau. "He's mad-crazy. I said hello and he brought the wall down on me."</p>
			<p>"That doesn't sound like him," Nuju said, frowning. "You, maybe, but not him. Did you say anything to anger Onewa?"</p>
			<p>Matau shook his head. "No. He waved and slide-down came the rocks. And look at this!"</p>
			<p>The Toa of Air pointed to a spot high on the partially ruined wall. Nuju leaned in close and saw it was a burn mark. "He did that, too," insisted Matau. "Whoosh, hot-flame."</p>
			<p>"All right. We had better find him," Nuju replied. "Before he finds someone else."</p>
			<h2>5</h2>
			<p>Nokama raced through the tunnels, fighting down her panic. A Rahkshi that wasn't a Rahkshi...what if Nuparu had not been Nuparu? What if all this was an elaborate trap for the Toa Metru? Bring them down into the dark, separate them, and then...</p>
			<p><i>No,</i> she told herself. <i>Get ahold of yourself. Of course, Nuparu was really who he seemed to be. The crisis down here is real, but so is the danger if I don't find the other Toa Metru soon.</i></p>
			<p>Nokama's wish was granted in the next moment, as a fireball whizzed past her. It was too far away to be meant as anything but a warning, but it still made her ready her hydro blades. Her eyes struggled to pierce the darkness to find the source of the flame.</p>
			<p>"This time you don't catch me by surprise." Vakama walked out of the shadows, disk launcher raised. "I don't know why you chose to turn on us, Nokama, but you'll never win."</p>
			<p>"Wait! You don't understand!" Nokama shouted.</p>
			<p>"You should have made sure I was defeated, Nokama," the Toa of Fire said as he launched a Kanoka disk at the Toa of Water.</p>
			<p>Nokama didn't hesitate. She dove aside as the disk narrowly missed her. An instant later, it struck a stalagmite and shrunk it down to the size of a pebble. Nokama gasped.</p>
			<p>"Vakama, don't make me defend myself," she cried. "Please listen to me!"</p>
			<p>"I'll be glad to, once I know you're wrapped up tight," the Toa of Fire answered. He bent down and placed his palm on the stone floor. Nokama's eyes widened as the rock began to glow red, the wave of heat heading right for her.</p>
			<p>"That...does...it!" Nokama said, launching herself into a flip. In midair, she hurled blasts of water at Vakama. Caught unawares, the Toa of Fire was swept off his feet and hit the ground hard. Nokama twisted her body and landed behind him.</p>
			<p>But Vakama was ready for her. Guessing correctly where she would land, he rolled and came up launching another disk. This one found its target and Nokama felt an awful weakness overtake her. She dropped to her knees, barely able to hold her tools aloft.</p>
			<p>The Toa of Fire got to his feet. "Stay down, Nokama. Please."</p>
			<p>Nokama lifted her head and looked at Vakama. A horrible thought struck her: How could she know if this was really her friend? Maybe whatever impersonated the Rahkshi was after her again, this time in the form of someone she trusted. If that was the case, she couldn't afford to lose this struggle. Who knew what this...whatever it was... might be planning for the other Toa Metru?</p>
			<p>Nokama struggled to draw on her elemental energies. If she could flood the tunnel, she could escape and warn the others. But she moved too slowly. Vakama had another disk ready, and was about to launch.</p>
			<p>A sudden tremor rocked the tunnel. Rock rained down on the Toa of Fire, knocking him to the ground. Nokama looked past him to see the source: Onewa, eyes gleaming, proto pitons driven into the ground.</p>
			<p>"Get away from her, Vakama," he snarled. "Time to put out your fire."</p>
			<p>Nuju and Matau felt the tremor and immediately quickened their pace. "Do you have a thought-plan on what we do if Onewa's really turned bad?"</p>
			<p>"We stop him," Nuju replied.</p>
			<p>"No wonder you were a quick-smart scholar," Matau said, making no attempt to hide his sarcasm. "Then what? Give him to the Vahki? How will that make the rest of us Toa-heroes look?"</p>
			<p>Matau had a good point. Nuju hated it when that happened. He could just picture showing up at the Coliseum to meet Turaga Dume, five Toa Metru with one tied up for delivery to the order enforcement squads. What kind of confidence would that inspire in the Matoran of Metru Nui? They would be finished before they even got started.</p>
			<p>Another tremor shook the tunnels. "Let's worry about that when we capture him," said Nuju. "If we capture him."</p>
			<p>Vakama was in the middle of a nightmare.</p>
			<p>On one side, Nokama had recovered from her bout of weakness and was sending spheres of water in his direction. On the other, Onewa, apparently infected with the same madness she was, was bringing down half the tunnel. All the while, the Toa of Stone was ranting some nonsense about Vakama ambushing him.</p>
			<p>Vakama still had no idea what was wrong with the two of them, but one thing was certain, he could not defeat two Toa Metru. It was all he could do to dodge Nokama's powers while melting the stone Onewa rained down on him. He wondered where Nuju, Matau, and Whenua were, or whether they had already fallen to their traitorous "friends".</p>
			<p>There was no way Vakama could keep dodging forever without making a mistake. Moving to avoid flying rock, he placed himself in the path of one of Nokama's water bursts. The impact sent him to his knees. Onewa moved in for the capture.</p>
			<p>"Maybe Turaga Dume will know how to heal whatever's wrong with you, fire-spitter," said the Toa of Stone. "Now I'll take the disk launcher."</p>
			<p>Onewa reached for Vakama's Toa tool. But before he could grab it away, a sudden gust of wind lifted the Toa of Stone off his feet and hurled him down the tunnel. Vakama looked up to see Matau and Nuju standing nearby.</p>
			<p>"Surprise," said the Toa of Air. "We followed your earth-shakers, Onewa, and got here everquick. Now why did you drop a wall on me?"</p>
			<p><i>So I was right,</i> Vakama thought. <i>Something is wrong with Onewa. Matau just proved it!</i></p>
			<p>Nokama rushed to help Onewa up and the two of them stood together. "You're wrong, Matau. It's Vakama that has turned bad, not Onewa. You have to help us stop him."</p>
			<p>"No! Onewa has tricked you," answered Matau.</p>
			<p>Something is very wrong here," Nuju said, just loud enough to catch everyone's attention. "Vakama took me by surprise, and Nokama says he did Onewa, too. But Matau says Onewa is the culprit...an Onewa who has the power of fire as well as stone."</p>
			<p>"That's crazy!" snapped Onewa. "I haven't even seen Matau since we split up!"</p>
			<p>"And Nokama challenged me," said Vakama. "This place must be driving us all mad."</p>
			<p>"I suggest we stop fighting until we figure out the truth," said Nuju.</p>
			<p>Slowly, reluctantly, the other Toa Metru accepted the wisdom of his words. They lowered their Toa tools and eyed one another warily. Onewa and Nokama stood on one side, Nuju and Matau on the other, and Vakama in the middle. But the voice that finally broke the uncomfortable silence did not belong to any of the five of them.</p>
			<p>"About time," said Whenua, walking down the tunnel. "I thought I was going to have to wade into the middle of all of you."</p>
			<p>The other Toa Metru all began talking at once, either warning Whenua or trying to explain how the conflict started. It was impossible to make out anything in the chaos of voices.</p>
			<p>"Enough!" Whenua shouted. "You're all wrong. All of you were ambushed by another Toa Metru...and none of you were."</p>
			<p>"What are you talking about?" demanded Onewa. "I know what happened to me."</p>
			<p>Only Nokama seemed to understand. "Of course...the Rahkshi I saw-"</p>
			<p>"Let me guess," said Whenua. "It looked like a Rahkshi, but something was off."</p>
			<p>"Yes! How did you know?"</p>
			<p>"It's called a Krahka, and I encountered it, too," the Toa of Earth explained. "A very dangerous Rahi. She defends herself by mimicking the appearance of an enemy, so well that she adapts their powers and abilities, too."</p>
			<p>"That explains 'Onewa' using stone and fire powers at once. This Krahka must have adapted Vakama's powers and then his," said Nuju.</p>
			<p>"But why is she after us? What did we do?" asked Nokama.</p>
			<p>Whenua frowned. "This is her territory. We're intruders. Maybe she wants to drive us out."</p>
			<p>"So what do we do? Run back up to Metru Nui because this thing wants us to?" said Onewa. "What about the Archives? What about the flooding?"</p>
			<p>Whenua didn't have an answer for that. It was Vakama who finally said, "We stick together from now on. That way we can't be taken by surprise."</p>
			<p>"That's quick-smart," said Matau. "And maybe we should hunt-track this Krahka before we worry about the leak."</p>
			<p>"No!" said Whenua. "I think we need to get out now. You don't know what a Krahka is capable of."</p>
			<p>The other Toa Metru looked at one another. It was Whenua's metru, and they had planned on letting him take the lead. But Toa running from anything, for any reason, felt wrong. Nuju put their feelings into words, saying, "Are we going to the Coliseum, then-or fleeing to it?"</p>
			<p>Nokama looked at Vakama, thinking, <i>This is the time. Step up and be a leader. Make this decision.</i></p>
			<p>But Vakama didn't speak. Instead, it was Onewa who said, "No mindless Rahi is going to make me run. I say we go on, capture this thing, and then do what we set out to do here. Who's with me?"</p>
			<p>One by one, all of the Toa Metru stepped forward. Whenua was the last to join the group. "All right, if we are going to do this," the Toa of Earth said, "then I better act as guide. I can take a guess where the Krahka might be hiding."</p>
			<p>The six Toa Metru started walking through the tunnels, Whenua in the lead. Matau and Nuju trailed along behind, the Toa of Air looking puzzled.</p>
			<p>"Nuju?"</p>
			<p>"What?"</p>
			<p>"If this Krahka can seem-look like anything it's seen...how will we know when we have found it?"</p>
			<p>It was a very good question. Nuju wished he had a very good answer.</p>
			<h2>6</h2>
			<p>They had not been traveling for very long before most of the Toa Metru lost all track of where they were or how to get back. No one had thought to mark a trail as they proceeded through the tunnels. For his part, Whenua moved through the maze with complete confidence, never hesitating at any of the intersections.</p>
			<p>So far, the journey had been without incident. The few small Rahi they had encountered ran from them. At one point, Vakama thought he spotted the gold Rahkshi, but it disappeared into the shadows before he could get a good look.</p>
			<p>"Elementary translation," Nokama said softly.</p>
			<p>Nuju turned to her. "What?"</p>
			<p>"Elementary translation. That's what I would have been teaching today...if I had not become a Toa Metru."</p>
			<p>"Do you regret the change?" asked the Toa of Ice.</p>
			<p>Nokama shrugged. "No. No, of course not. We are heroes, aren't we? We can do things no one else can. But...when was the last time you saw a Toa playing a sport? Or jumping into chutes for the fun of it? Or doing any of the things Matoran do every day?"</p>
			<p>Silence was Nuju's answer. His memory of Toa Lhikan was of a larger than life figure, defending the city against any threat and then returning, exhausted, to wait for the next call to action. He never seemed to have time for fun or friendship.</p>
			<p>"I am not complaining about all we have gained," Nokama continued. "Just missing all we may have lost."</p>
			<p>"Perhaps it is up to us to be a different kind of Toa Metru," said Nuju. "And to make sure that any Toa who follow us learn these lessons as well."</p>
			<p>Whenua held up a hand. "Stop. Look ahead."</p>
			<p>The floor of the tunnel before them had collapsed, evidently long ago. A flimsy bridge made from Le-Metru cable had been constructed over the chasm. It was the right width and strength for a party of Matoran crossing, but looked far too weak to support six Toa Metru.</p>
			<p>"Is there another way across?" asked Nokama.</p>
			<p>Whenua shook his head.</p>
			<p>"Then we go this way, earth-digger," said Onewa. "One at a time."</p>
			<p>The bridge consisted of a single cable, attached to two others higher up that served as handrails. Whenua stepped carefully onto the cable and began to quickly make his way across. When he was halfway across the span, the darkness below the bridge began to move.</p>
			<p>"Mata Nui protect us...what is that?" said Nokama.</p>
			<p>Nuju peered over the edge. "Stone rats. Thousands of them."</p>
			<p>"Hundreds of thousands," said Vakama. "Their warrens must have been disturbed when the tunnel collapsed."</p>
			<p>"Dangerous?" asked Matau.</p>
			<p>"You wouldn't want one for a pet," Onewa replied. "Their teeth are made for eating through solid rock. Put an Ussal cart or a chute, or even a Knowledge Tower, between them and dinner and they'll eat that, too."</p>
			<p>Whenau kept moving as if he hadn't even noticed the creatures below. He reached the other side and beckoned the others to follow. Nokama took a step onto the bridge and paused, seeing the thousands of red eyes down below and hearing the chittering of hungry stone rats.</p>
			<p>"How come the Chronicles never talk about things like this?" she said.</p>
			<p>"Probably because the Chronicler ran away," Onewa chuckled. "Only Toa are brave enough for this kind of work."</p>
			<p>"Brave enough, or foolish enough?"</p>
			<p>"Brave, if we make it across," the Toa of Stone answered. "Foolish, if we don't."</p>
			<p>Nokama closed her eyes and focused all her concentration within. Ga-Metru Matoran were trained in both mental and physical disciplines, for the two went hand in hand. She struggled to remember all that she had learned about maintaining perfect balance. When she finally felt ready, the Toa of Water opened her eyes and started across the bridge.</p>
			<p>As she walked, slowly and steadily, nothing existed for her except the cable beneath her feet. There were no rats below, no Toa behind, no sights or sounds that were not directly related to her task. She was not even aware that she had made it to the other side until Whenua grabbed her hand to steady her for the last few steps.</p>
			<p>"Well, if she can do it..." said Matau. Then he sprang into the air, flipped over, and grabbed both hand cables. As the other Toa watched in shock, he proceeded to cross the bridge by walking on his hands. "This is the way a Toa-hero does it!"</p>
			<p>"That's the way an Ussal driver who's gone round one chute too many does it," muttered Onewa. "Vakama, you're next."</p>
			<p>If the Toa of Fire was fearful, he didn't show it. Disk launcher at the ready, he walked as swiftly as he could across the cable. He had almost reached the end when he heard Nokama shout his name.</p>
			<p>Vakama whirled to see a ghostly figure rising from the sea of stone rats. At first its identity wasn't clear. But as it passed through the bridge to hover in the air, he could see it was a Rahkshi with a black head and spine, and dark green claws and feet. Vakama launched a disk at the floating creature, only to see it pass right through the target.</p>
			<p>"Nothing to fear-worry about," said Matau. "If you can't touch it, then it can't touch you, right?"</p>
			<p>The Rahkshi screeched in answer. Then before the Toa's startled eyes, it whent from ghostly to solid and plunged down. The creature struck the bridge, tearing one end loose. Vakama grabbed the cable and hung on as he slammed into the rock wall.</p>
			<p>Down below, the stone rats scrambled in anticipation of the Rahkshi falling toward them. At the last moment, the creature's density changed once more and it floated upward again. Frustrated, a few of the stone rats turned to the end of the cable bridge now resting in their midst. Cautiously at first, they began to climb the cable. Seeing their success, more began to follow, crawling toward Vakama.</p>
			<p>The Toa of Fire climbed hand over hand toward the ledge. Nokama held out her hydro blade for him to grab on to. "Hurry! They're coming!"</p>
			<p>Vakama looked down. The stone rats were now racing up the cable. In moments, they would be upon him and then up onto the ledge where Nokama, Matau, and Whenua stood. He could tell he would not make it all the way up in time. There was only one thing left to do.</p>
			<p>Grabbing a disk, Vakama slammed it into the cable. The weakness power in the Kanoka disk combined with the sharp edge of the disk itself to sever the line. Toa of Fire, bridge, and stone rats fell together toward the chasm far below.</p>
			<p>"Vakama!" Nokama screamed.</p>
			<p>Onewa and Nuju watched helplessly as their friend plummeted down. "Ice?"</p>
			<p>"I tried," said Nuju. "My elemental powers are exhausted!"</p>
			<p>Matau pushed past Nokama. "Not losing a Toa-friend today!" Before she could stop him, he dove off the ledge.</p>
			<p>Vakama saw the Toa of Air plunging toward him. Matau was shouting, "Slow yourself! Flip over, Vakama!"</p>
			<p>The Toa of Fire had no idea what Matau was planning, but he wasn't going to argue. Letting go of the cable, Vakama executed a series of midair flips to slow his fall. As he completed the third one, he felt Matau grab his wrists.</p>
			<p>"Now we go high-flying!" shouted Matau.</p>
			<p>A sudden gust of wind lifted both Toa toward the ceiling. Vakama glanced below to see the cable bridge disappearing beneath the swarm of stone rats.</p>
			<p>"Beats ground-walking now, doesn't it?" laughed Matau.</p>
			<p>"Sure. Unless you fly right into a Rahkshi. Watch out!"</p>
			<p>Matau turned to see the Rahkshi hovering right in his path. Unable to shift the winds in time to change their course, he and Vakama plunged right through the misty substance of the creature. Then the Rahkshi suddenly solidified and grabbed on to Vakama's leg. Toa Metru and Rahkshi dropped like a stone.</p>
			<p>"Matau! We need a stronger wind!" shouted Vakama.</p>
			<p>"Or one less wind-rider!" snapped Matau.</p>
			<p>The Toa of Fire tried to shake off the Rahkshi, but the creature wasn't letting go. He mustered the strongest flame he could, but the Rahkshi simply turned insubstantial and let the fire go right through it before resuming its grip on Vakama.</p>
			<p>"It's not letting go!"</p>
			<p>"It will, Toa-brother," replied Matau. "I don't think it will like where we're going!"</p>
			<p>The Toa of Air summoned all his strength and channeled it into a powerful wind that flung the three of them on a collision course with the rock wall. Vakama glanced up to see complete determination in Matau's eyes. He never wavered as he steered them directly toward a final crash.</p>
			<p><i>Great,</i> thought Vakama. <i>Never thought my last moments would be spent with a deranged Toa who thinks he's a Gukko bird.</i></p>
			<p>The Toa of Fire was tempted to close his eyes as the wall grew closer and closer. But he did not. Toa Lhikan would have met his end with eyes open and head held high, and Vakama would not shame that tradition by showing fear.</p>
			<p>An instant before a certain, shattering impact, Matau suddenly swerved upward, taking Vakama with him. The Rahkshi was whipped hard toward the wall and instinctively turned intangible to avoid the crash. Its hands slipped right through Vakama's ankle and it sailed off, passing through the rock and disappearing into the wall.</p>
			<p>Matau winced at the sight. "Hope that Rahkshi doesn't think to go solid while it's in there."</p>
			<p>Suddenly, the Toa dropped, rose, and then dropped again. "What's going on?" asked Vakama.</p>
			<p>"My power is fading!" answered Matau. "The winds won't close-listen anymore!"</p>
			<p>The Toa of Air fought to stay aloft. More than once, it looked as if they were going to become much better acquainted with the stone rats than either Toa wanted to. Finally, Matau managed to steer them above the ledge where Nokama and Whenua waited. That was when his power at last gave out completely, sending them both toward the stone floor.</p>
			<p>Nokama moved quickly to catch Vakama. But Matau fell hard right in front of Whenua, who did not act in time to prevent it. "Thanks for the quick-save," the Toa of Air grumbled. "Next time, you can rescue the fire-spitter and I will stay safe on the ledge."</p>
			<p>"What you did was very brave," Nokama said to Matau. "But you shouldn't have had to do it." She turned to Vakama. "We could have handled the stone rats, if it came to that, Vakama. You didn't have to sacrifice yourself."</p>
			<p>There was no anger in her words, but they stung just the same. Worse, Vakama knew she was right. They were all Toa Metru now. By acting like he had to protect the others, he had only succeeded in placing his and Matau's lives at risk.</p>
			<p><i>Will I ever be done learning how to be a Toa?</i> he wondered. <i>The lessons keep getting harder. Fail one and you may not get a chance to try another.</i></p>
			<p>"I wish I could say all is well, but we still have a problem," said Nokama, gesturing across the chasm. "Make that three. Two Toa Metru on the other side, and no bridge. So...whose turn is it to come up with the great idea?"</p>
			<p>Watching from the other side, Onewa shook his head. "If we wait for that group to save us, we will end up Rahi bones here. What do you say we take a leap into the future, Nuju?"</p>
			<p>Before the Toa of Ice could respond, Onewa had grabbed him by the arm and jumped off the ledge. His powerful legs propelled them well out over the chasm, but nowhere near far enough to reach the other Toa. It looked as if the stone rats were about to receive two unexpected gifts.</p>
			<p>Onewa did not look at all worried. As the two Toa reached the apex of their leap, he used his Toa power on the ground far below. An instant later, a pillar of stone shot up midway across the span and directly in the path of the Toa of Stone.</p>
			<p>Casting one of his proto pitons ahead of him, Onewa caught the pillar with it and swung to relative safety, Nuju in tow. The Toa of Ice looked at him and said coldly, "Don't...<i>ever</i>...do...that...again."</p>
			<p>"Relax, scholar," replied Onewa. "You'll get used to it."</p>
			<p>With a yell, Onewa launched the two of them into the air again. The other Toa Metru scattered just in time as they landed on the ledge, Onewa tucking and rolling to minimize the impact and Nuju crashing hard into the rock.</p>
			<p>The Toa of Stone was the first to reach his feet, in time to see Nuju rise and charge toward him. Vakama moved quickly to keep the two apart. "If my powers were at their peak, hammer-swinger, no one would be hearing from you until the thaw," growled Nuju.</p>
			<p>"Big talk from a stargazer," snapped Onewa. "Try doing real work sometime."</p>
			<p>"Hold it!" said Vakama. "Both of you. We have done enough fighting among ourselves."</p>
			<p>"This is no way for Toa Metru to behave," said Nokama. "What would Turaga Dume say if he saw this?"</p>
			<p>"Turaga Dume will never get the chance to anger-speak or anything else to us if we don't get moving," said Matau. "Save the shout-loud for when we are out of this place."</p>
			<p>"Yes, let us keep moving. We are almost at the end," said Whenua, frowning. Without waiting for an answer from his friends, he turned and started walking farther into the tunnels.</p>
			<p>Matau watched him go and shook his head. "If he gets any more dark and grim, I will call him Toa of Mud."</p>
			<p>Nokama said nothing. But her eyes never left Whenua as the team resumed its journey.</p>
			<h2>7</h2>
			<p>The Toa of Stone caught up to Whenua sometime later. "Any plan for what we do when we find this thing?"</p>
			<p>"No," Whenua answered.</p>
			<p>"Ever had to get a shape-shifter like this into the Archives before?"</p>
			<p>The Toa of Earth seemed to puzzle over that question for a long time, before he finally said, "How would we know if we had?"</p>
			<p>The path narrowed, and then widened again. Although their lightstones were still working well, the gloom seemed heavier here and the shadows harder to drive away. Eventually, despite the bright glow of the stones, the darkness became impossible to pierce and the Toa Metru were forced to halt.</p>
			<p>"This cannot be natural," said Nokama quietly. "This blackness feels almost...alive."</p>
			<p>"I think you are imagining things," said Nuju. "Darkness is just the absence of light. It cannot be a living thing."</p>
			<p>"Let's keep going," said Onewa. "Follow my voice, this way. No, wait, I think that's the way we came. Maybe we had better go the other way. I-"</p>
			<p>The Toa of Stone's voice cut off abruptly. Nokama called his name, but he did not answer. The other Toa Metru stood perfectly still, but could not hear their friend-or anything else-moving.</p>
			<p>Finally, Whenua said, "This way," and the others moved toward the sound. They walked single file, the Toa of Earth in the lead, followed by Nokama, Nuju, Matau, and Vakama. If Onewa was trailing along behind, he gave no sign. Every now and then, one of the Toa would glance over their shoulder, but no one could see anything through the shadows.</p>
			<p>Vakama was troubled. Onewa might not be the easiest Toa to work with, but he was no coward. He wouldn't have just run off and abandoned his friends.</p>
			<p><i>Something happened to him, and if we're not careful, the same thing will happen to us,</i> he said to himself.</p>
			<p>Even as the words raced through Vakama's mind, something snaked through the darkness to wrap around his legs, arms, and mask. For a moment, he thought perhaps the Morbuzakh vines had returned, but this felt different. Then lack of air cut off his thoughts and he blacked out. The mysterious thing that had grabbed Vakama now dragged him away.</p>
			<p>"Vakama, perhaps your fire could brighten the way," Nokama said. "Do you have enough power left to try?"</p>
			<p>But the Toa of Fire did not answer. Nokama stopped short, and Nuju walked into her. "Why are you stopping?" asked the Toa of Ice.</p>
			<p>"I think Vakama is gone, too!" she answered. "Something is in this darkness with us, Nuju. How do we fight what we can't see?"</p>
			<p>She reached out to find Nuju. But her hand instead encountered what felt like an energy field. A tingle ran up her arm and she pulled back violently as her limb began to grow dead. "Nuju! I felt something!"</p>
			<p>When Nokama extended her arm a second time, the field was gone...and so was the Toa of Ice.</p>
			<p>"Whenua! Matau! Are you there?"</p>
			<p>"Ground-walking right behind you," said Matau. "What's happened to the others?"</p>
			<p>"They found side passages?" suggested Whenua.</p>
			<p>Nokama was surprised that the Toa of Earth did not sound more concerned. But then he knew better than any of them how easy it was to get lost down here.</p>
			<p>"I think we should link hands," Nokama said.</p>
			<p>"Great idea!" Matau replied. "But maybe Whenua should scout ahead, and we two can stay hand-linked back here."</p>
			<p>"Very funny, Matau."</p>
			<p>Nokama took hold of Whenua's hand. But when she reached for Matau's, the Toa of Air was gone. It took every bit of her willpower not to panic. If the other Toa were in danger, only she and Whenua were left to save them.</p>
			<p>Now Whenua was tugging her forward so hard that she almost left her feet. The darkness was breaking up around her now and she could see flashes of stone walls. The next moment, the oppressive shadow was gone completely and Nokama blinked as she adjusted to the sudden light.</p>
			<p>She and Whenua were standing in a cavern, alone. There was no sign of the other Toa or what had taken them. The Toa of Earth looked around and said, "I warned them this would be dangerous. We should have turned back."</p>
			<p>"It's too late for that now," snapped Nokama. "We have to find them. I'm not leaving these tunnels without the others."</p>
			<p>"Well, that's half right," muttered Whenua. "Going back will just get us trapped. We should go forward. If they are lost...I doubt they will ever be found."</p>
			<p>Nokama whirled to look at the Toa of Earth. Whenua had made those comments as if he were talking about a misplaced tool. "You're right, Whenua. It is very dangerous down here, isn't it? But the Toa of Earth volunteered to guide us through the tunnels of his metru. That way, we could avoid the most perilous spots-or could we?"</p>
			<p>She crossed her hydro blades in front of her and took a step back, now battle ready. "The six Toa Metru could triumph over any foe. But if one of us was <i>not</i> one of us, treachery would win the day. That is what you counted on, wasn't it, Krahka?"</p>
			<p>Before Nokama's eyes, "Whenua" morphed into the exact image of Vakama. "I wondered when you would figure it out, Toa. You would not leave my domain, even when one of your own suggested it...and now you will never leave."</p>
			<p>"So some of what you said was the truth," Nokama answered. "You can look like any one of us. And you were the Rahkshi I encountered, weren't you?"</p>
			<p>Another shift and now Nokama was facing the yellow Rahkshi. Then she turned back to Vakama. "Yes. No real Rahkshi would be fooled, but their senses are more acute than yours."</p>
			<p>"Why go to all this trouble?" Nokama said, circling to get the best defensive position. "Why not just appear as Turaga Dume and order us out of the tunnels?"</p>
			<p>"I can only take the form of those I have encountered," said the Krahka, quickly shapeshifting from Vakama to Nuju to Onewa. "And it took me time to learn your language. When I first met Vakama, in your shape, I could only repeat back words he had said to me."</p>
			<p>Now the Krahka cycled through all six Toa Metru, ending up as Whenua again. "Now I have learned. I have adapted. It is too late for all of you."</p>
			<p>"Where's the real Whenua? What have you done to him?"</p>
			<p>"No more than I did to the rest of the Toa," the Krahka said in Whenua's booming voice. "These tunnels are a haven for Rahkshi. Rahkshi who can coil their elastic bodies around you...or teleport you away...or trap you in a stasis field...or simply cloak you in silence so no one can hear you scream."</p>
			<p>Nokama kept moving, staying out of the reach of the Krahka. She knew that the longer the Rahi talked, the more time her elemental powers would have to strengthen. "Why not just let us leave? We mean no harm to you."</p>
			<p>For just a split second, the Krahka took on the hideous form of a half Rahkshi, half Toa. Then she changed to Matau. "Because you would not leave. Top-dwellers never do. But this is my place. Here you are the invaders. You are not welcome."</p>
			<p>Nokama started to reply, then stopped short. The Krahka's words could have just as easily been said by the Toa to the Morbuzakh plant when it threatened Metru Nui. Was this creature really doing nothing more than defending her home? Still, Nokama had to save her friends. If the Krahka was determined to get in the way, then a clash was inevitable.</p>
			<p>"You realize if we don't return, more 'top-dwellers' will come down here," said the Toa of Water. "They will search for us. Your home will be torn apart. Is that really what you want?"</p>
			<p>"If they search for you, they will find you," said the Krahka, shifting to Vakama's form. Then in the voice of the Toa of Fire, she said, "The Toa Metru have discovered a danger to the city lurking far underground. We are going to stay here until the danger is ended."</p>
			<p>Nokama's mind reeled. She had never even considered...but it made sense. The Krahka could fool everyone into thinking the Toa safe and on a mission. For that matter, other than Nuparu, who even knew they were down here? Who would go looking for them?</p>
			<p>Three shapes emerged from the tunnels and into the cave. They were Rahkshi, one silver, one black-white, one tan-blue. "I sensed great power in you, Nokama, more than you realize," said the Krahka. "It is a shame you will never live up to your potential."</p>
			<p>Vakama/Krahka slipped away as the three Rahkshi moved in. They seemed to shy away from the Krahka, perhaps disturbed by the conflict between what they scented and what they saw. But they had no such reluctance about pursuing Nokama.</p>
			<p>The three spread out, surrounding Nokama. She feinted right and then dove for the legs of the tan-blue Rahkshi. But when she reached the spot, the creature faded away as if it had never been there. Then it reappeared a short distance away.</p>
			<p><i>Teleportation?</i> Nokama wondered as she scrambled to her feet. <i>No...illusion. I see it where it's not.</i></p>
			<p>She did not have much time to think about that. The silver Rahkshi hurled a lightning bolt in her direction. She managed to dodge the full impact, but enough of the energy brushed her that she was thrown across the room. Nokama never struck the ground, though. Instead, she found herself whirled about in a cyclone created by the black-white Rahkshi.</p>
			<p>When the winds abruptly died down, Nokama landed hard on the cavern floor. Staggering, she had to make a real effort to draw herself up to her hands and knees. The three Rahkshi stood their ground, not coming close enough for her to grab. She tried to stand up, but a jagged bolt of lightning just above her head killed that idea.</p>
			<p>Strangely enough, the Rahkshi's actions made her feel less fearful. If they had been convinced they could defeat her, they would have closed in already. Instead, they maintained their distance and tried to keep her off balance.</p>
			<p><i>They don't know what to make of me,</i> she realized. <i>Maybe they have never seen a Toa before. That means they have no idea how powerful I might be.</i></p>
			<p>"I appreciate the rest. All that walking was tiring," she said, trying to sound confident. "You do not believe a mere three of you can stop a Toa, though, do you?"</p>
			<p>The Rahkshi stirred. They didn't understand the words, but they sensed that the tone was not that of a defeated foe. Nokama was trying to decide what to do next when she heard a welcome sound-the dripping of liquid protodermis through a minute crack in the wall. The leak was only a short distance away, to her left, but the black-white Rahkshi was between her and the slowly forming puddle.</p>
			<p><i>Just where I want him,</i> she thought.</p>
			<p>"Compared to what I just faced up above, you three aren't even worth wasting my Toa power on. Oh, maybe you scare all the little Rahi that skitter around down here, but up above we laugh at things like you," she continued.</p>
			<p>Nokama kept talking to distract the Rahkshi from what she was really doing-extending her power to draw a stream of liquid protodermis from the site of the leak right to her. Conveniently, the stream passed right beneath the feet of the black-white Rahkshi.</p>
			<p>"Actually, you are fortunate to have run into me," she said, mockingly. "Vakama or Nuju, they might really hurt you."</p>
			<p>The thin line of liquid had almost reached her. The black-white Rahkshi's attention was focused on her. It had never noticed what she had done. Now it was time to see if her plan was going to work.</p>
			<p>She locked her gaze on the silver Rahkshi and snarled, "I have had enough of this. Get out of my way." Then she lunged forward as if about to spring.</p>
			<p>The Rahkshi reacted with a bolt of chain lightning, but Nokama wasn't sitting and waiting for it. Instead of springing, she rolled to her left. The bolt struck where she had been, hitting the stream of protodermis and traveling along it right back to the black-white Rahkshi. The current slammed into the creature and sent him flying.</p>
			<p>Nokama swung her hydro blades hard and cleaved open the wall at the site of the leak. Liquid protodermis gushed through the gap, rapidly filling the cave. Both Rahkshi's faceplates opened to reveal very disturbed kraata, screeching their rage.</p>
			<p>Then she noticed an unexpected benefit of the flood. The liquid was disturbed a few feet to the right of the tan-blue Rahkshi. That was where the true creature stood, well away from the illusion. She mustered her energy and sent a mini-tidal wave toward the spot. When it struck, the illusion vanished and the real Rahkshi appeared, knocked off its feet.</p>
			<p><i>One out of the fight, one stunned,</i> she said to herself. <i>And one to go.</i></p>
			<p>She had half hoped the silver Rahkshi would back off. But if anything, all she had succeeded in doing was making it angry. Wary, too-having seen what happened to its brother, it wasn't going to be hurling any more lightning bolts around. Still, it advanced toward Nokama through the waist-deep liquid, claws outstretched.</p>
			<p>The Toa of Water nodded. She knew the best she could hope for was to slow down these creatures and buy time for escape. So far, she had been lucky. But now the silver Rahkshi had taken her measure and was prepared for her moves. <i>All but one,</i> she reminded herself.</p>
			<p>Without warning, she dove beneath the surface of the protodermis and rocketed toward the Rahkshi. At the last moment, she veered off and began circling it at enormous speed. By the time the creature grasped what was happening, it was too late. The Rahkshi was caught inside a powerful waterspout, heading for the ceiling.</p>
			<p>Nokama kept swimming, faster and faster, until she heard the sharp crack of Rahkshi armor striking stone high above. Then she abruptly stopped and let the spout dissipate. The Rahkshi crashed into the liquid and then floated to the surface, lying on its back. Its faceplate was open and the leechlike kraata inside was trying to squirm out.</p>
			<p>Nokama decided there would never be a better time to leave.</p>
			<h2>8</h2>
			<p>She found Vakama, Matau, and Onewa fairly easily. All three were unconscious but unharmed, tucked away in alcoves until the Rahkshi decided just what to do with them. Nuju was more of a problem. The Toa of Ice was surrounded by some kind of energy field that could not be pierced. His heartlight flashed and his eyes were open, but he seemed unaware of what was going on.</p>
			<p>"You know, I think I like him better this way," Onewa commented.</p>
			<p>"Yes, but do you want to lift-carry him everywhere?" asked Matau. "I don't."</p>
			<p>Vakama tried again to reach inside the field. This time, the resulting jolt was so violent he dropped his disk launcher. Onewa bent to pick it up.</p>
			<p>"Here, fire-spitter. I know you would be lost without it," the Toa of Stone said.</p>
			<p>Matau smiled, but the expression quickly faded, replaced by a look of excitement. He rushed to where the other two Toa Metru were standing. "The launcher! That is the puzzle-answer!"</p>
			<p>Onewa looked at Matau as if the Toa of Air had lost his mind, especially when he started sifting through Vakama's disks searching for just the right one. Suddenly, he held one high and said, "Aha! Found it!"</p>
			<p>Matau had grabbed a teleportation disk. The Toa of Fire was beginning to get an idea of what his friend had in mind, and decided Onewa was probably right: he was crazy.</p>
			<p>"See? Nuju is inside the field, but not part of it. So if you quick-launch a teleportation disk at the field..."</p>
			<p>"And if you're wrong, we send Nuju to Mata Nui only knows where," Onewa said. "It's too dangerous."</p>
			<p>Vakama took the disk from Matau. "But we're going to do it," he said, loading it into the launcher. "We have no choice. The only alternatives are leave him here, or hope to track down whatever did this to him and get them to undo it."</p>
			<p>"Easy for you to say, mask-maker," grumbled Onewa. "You're not the one stuck inside that thing."</p>
			<p>"If Matau's plan fails, Nuju is no worse off than he is now," Nokama interjected. "He is just no worse off someplace else."</p>
			<p>Vakama raised the launcher. "Stand aside, Onewa."</p>
			<p>"Listen, you can't tell me-"</p>
			<p>Nokama laid a hand on Onewa's arm and gently guided him off to the side. "Please. Every moment we delay here could mean greater danger for Whenua."</p>
			<p>Vakama took a deep breath. Hitting the target would be easy, but there was no telling what effect the disk would have. If Nuju vanished along with the field, they might never see him again. <i>But he always says we don't worry enough about consequences anyway. Now we will see if he's right,</i> Vakama said to himself.</p>
			<p>The disk flew from the launcher and struck the energy field. There was a bright flash, blinding for the Toa who had spent so much time in near darkness. Then Matau hurried forward to catch a collapsing Nuju.</p>
			<p>"It worked!" the Toa of Air shouted. "Meet the wisest of all Toa-heroes!"</p>
			<p>"Is Nuju all right?" asked Nokama. "Is he hurt?"</p>
			<p>The Toa of Ice looked around at the other Toa Metru. Then he said, "Why are we standing around here? We need to find the Krahka so we can get out of this foul pit. Why any Matoran would want to spend time underground is beyond me."</p>
			<p>"He's healthy-fine!" announced Matau.</p>
			<p>Nokama led the way deeper into the tunnels. She was operating purely on instinct. There was no logical reason to believe Whenua was not somewhere back in the tunnel maze, unconscious or worse. But something told her the Krahka would not have left him there for the Toa to find.</p>
			<p><i>If I'm right, by the time the Krahka encountered Whenua, she knew the true power of the Toa,</i> Nokama told herself. <i>And she knew the Rahkshi might not be able to defeat us. I think Whenua is her protection against us.</i></p>
			<p>None of which made it any easier to guess which path the Krahka took. Faced with multiple choices, Nokama went with whichever tunnel was the narrowest and most treacherous. It only made sense, given that nothing else on this journey had been easy.</p>
			<p>Eventually, one of the Toa had to ask the question. It was Onewa who finally spoke up. "Nokama, do you have any idea where we're going?"</p>
			<p>"No. I don't know these tunnels, so I am guessing. I'm not Whenua."</p>
			<p>"That's all right," Matau said. "After all, it turned out Whenua wasn't Whenua either."</p>
			<p>"Does anyone else feel warm?" Nuju asked.</p>
			<p>Vakama reached up and touched one of the pipes that ran overhead. It was broiling hot. "We may be under Ta-Metru. That is molten protodermis in those pipes. So be careful-not even our Toa armor would protect us from the heat."</p>
			<p>"Is there anything else we need to worry about?" asked Onewa.</p>
			<p>Vakama gestured at a half dozen long, black shapes uncoiling from the pipes. "Oh, just those."</p>
			<p>Nokama jumped back so fast she slammed into Matau behind her. "<i>What</i>...are those?"</p>
			<p>One of the serpentlike creatures hit the ground. The stone sizzled and steamed underneath it. "We call them lava eels," said Vakama. "Sometimes Matoran find small ones near the forges and bring them home. Then they get too big and destructive, so they get abandoned. Some lurk around the furnaces, some hide in the reclamation yards...and some wind up here."</p>
			<p>"How destructive is destructive?" asked Nuju.</p>
			<p>Vakama bent down and tossed a handful of pebbles at one of the eels. No sooner had the small stones struck than they were reduced to ash.</p>
			<p>"I would guess their owners don't pet them very much," said the Toa of Ice.</p>
			<p>The lava eels drew closer and began to spread out. They left scorch marks everywhere they slithered. More eels appeared behind the Toa, apparently just as curious about their visitors. In a matter of moments, the heroes were surrounded.</p>
			<p>"Is this bad?" asked Nokama. "If so, how bad?"</p>
			<p>Vakama shook his head. "We are fine as long as we move slowly. Lava eels are not by nature hostile creatures. As long as nothing agitates them, we'll be able to-"</p>
			<p>The rest of the Toa of Fire's sentence was cut off by a roar that shook the tunnel. It was impossible to tell just where it came from, but its effects were obvious. The eels began to hiss and squirm, their bodies heating up rapidly. Almost too late, Onewa saw what was about to happen.</p>
			<p>"Jump!"</p>
			<p>All five Toa Metru leaped and grabbed on to the pipes as the tunnel floor dropped away beneath them. Some weren't so sure they had gained anything with the move, since the searing heat of the pipes made it nearly impossible to hang on.</p>
			<p>"They melted right through the stone!" Onewa said, looking down into the dark pit that yawned beneath his feet. "Whatever made that roar scared them."</p>
			<p>The roar came again, so loud it rattled the pipes and sent the eels slithering for cover. Now the Toa could see it came from a huge, dark shape that was pacing at the bottom of the pit. "I think we just seek-found 'whatever'-any idea what that is?" asked Matau.</p>
			<p>"I didn't think anything lived beneath the maintenance tunnels," Nokama said.</p>
			<p>The shadowy beast gave out another roar. "Maybe we just found the reason why that's so," Onewa replied. "Unless we want to get a closer look at our friend, we better move."</p>
			<p>One by one, the Toa began to swing back and forth on the pipes. Every move was agonizing as they clung to the boiling pipes. When they had built up enough momentum in their swings, they let go and sailed over the pit and onto the stone floor beyond. Their landings were neither soft nor gentle, but what mattered was being far from protodermis pipes and massive, angry Rahi.</p>
			<p>"Is everyone all right?" asked Vakama.</p>
			<p>"Battered. Burned. Bruised," reported Matau, smiling. "So what's our next Toa-hero deed?"</p>
			<p>"Sometimes I think you like this job a little too much," grumbled Onewa.</p>
			<p>Matau laughed. "We quick-save Matoran. We defeat evil. We get to explore ever-strange places like this. A little discomfort is not so very bad compared to that."</p>
			<p>Nokama smiled and shook her head. There were times it seemed that Matau might not be the brightest lightstone in the tunnel, and then he would come out and say just the right thing. He was correct, of course. For all the trouble and the danger, they were all having adventures they would never forget.</p>
			<p><i>Someday, we will look back on these times with wonder,</i> she thought. <i>We will share our tales, and all of Metru Nui will be amazed at what once went on here. I wonder how they will look at us? Will they even remember the Toa Metru?</i></p>
			<p>Vakama's voice interrupted her thoughts. "Nokama, we have to keep moving. Whenua is depending on us."</p>
			<p><i>Yes,</i> thought Nokama as she rose. <i>Time to write another tale of the Toa.</i></p>
			<p>Nuju volunteered to scout ahead. Nokama and Matau felt it better if all the Toa Metru stayed together, but he needed time to himself. There had been few spare moments to contemplate all the recent changes. The realization that he would no longer be a Ko-Metru seer, but instead the guardian of the entire metru, was...disturbing. Somehow, he had thought that once the Morbuzakh was defeated, he and the others would become Matoran again.</p>
			<p>Now, of course, he could see that was not so. Toa were Toa as long as they needed to fulfill their destiny. He wondered if he would ever get the chance for quiet study again, or if his life would now be nothing but twisted plants, giant Rahi, and rescuing Whenua.</p>
			<p>He slowed his pace as he neared a bend in the tunnel. Light was spilling out from somewhere up ahead, in a place where no light should be. He edged closer to the corner and stole a look ahead.</p>
			<p>The chamber beyond was large and dominated by a huge pit in the center filled with bubbling, molten protodermis. No one seemed to be in the cave, other than the occasional Rahkshi that would wander through and then leave in a hurry. Nuju guessed there must be a rear exit, probably another tunnel.</p>
			<p>He waited until the cave was completely empty before sneaking closer. From the cave mouth, it did not look any different. Lightstones were mounted around the chamber, but there did not seem to be any other signs of habitation. <i>Maybe something lived here, and left,</i> he thought.</p>
			<p>"Nuju! Up here!"</p>
			<p>Startled, the Toa of Ice looked up. There was Whenua, pasted to the ceiling above the pit by some sort of webbing. He was bound so tightly that only his head could move. "Is it really you?" he asked.</p>
			<p>"Of course it's-" Nuju began sharply. Then he remembered what it was the Toa Metru were challenging. When he spoke again, his tone was more gentle. "Yes, Whenua, it's really me. The others are not far behind. Are you all right?"</p>
			<p>"I have been hanging here trying to remember if a Toa ever met his end by being baked while stuck to a ceiling," Whenua replied. "I can't think of one. As an archivist, I am excited about discovering a first. As a Toa Metru, I am not looking forward to being remembered in the Chronicles for this."</p>
			<p>"You won't be. We'll find some way to get you down from there. But what happened to you?"</p>
			<p>"The Krahka, posing as Onewa, took me by surprise," said Whenua. "When I woke up, she had turned into something else-something awful-and I was bound like this. Where did you say the others were?"</p>
			<p>"We are here," Nokama said, surveying the scene from the cave mouth. "We have little time. Nuju, guard the other exit."</p>
			<p>The Toa of Ice turned to do as Nokama had asked. Too late, Whenua shouted a warning. Too late, Nuju turned to see that "Nokama" was now "Onewa" and stone was erupting from the cave floor to envelop him. In an instant Nuju was trapped in a cocoon of rock.</p>
			<p>"You Toa are so trusting," the Krahka hissed. "One day, it will be the death of you."</p>
			<h2>9</h2>
			<p>Nokama was growing concerned. Nuju had been gone for a long time, without so much as a word back to the others about what he had found. With the number of unexpected dangers down here, the Toa of Ice might be in just as much trouble as Whenua.</p>
			<p><i>Then again, he may simply be happier on his own,</i> she reminded herself. Ko-Matoran have never liked crowds.</p>
			<p>Vakama saw Nokama's demeanor and guessed what was bothering her. It was disturbing for him, as well, but for different reasons. "Nuju?" he asked.</p>
			<p>"Yes. We should never have let him go off alone. We should have insisted all of us stay together."</p>
			<p>"Do you think he would have listened if we had?" said Vakama. "Besides, he will be back. I know he will. And we have to be prepared."</p>
			<p>"What are you talking about?" asked Nokama.</p>
			<p>"Get Onewa and Matau. We have a great deal to discuss, and not much time."</p>
			<p>As Vakama predicted, it did not take long for Nuju to reappear. "I thought you would have made more progress by now," he said.</p>
			<p>"We were waiting to hear from you," Vakama replied. "What did you find?"</p>
			<p>"Nothing but more and more tunnels. I thought I saw light at one point down a side branch, but then it disappeared. Probably just some glowing Rahi."</p>
			<p>"Probably. Well, we have decided to stop here for a while until help arrives."</p>
			<p>"Help?" asked Nuju. "What help? And where is Matau?"</p>
			<p>Nokama shook her head. "We realized while you were gone that this place is simply too big for us to search. We will never find Whenua this way. So Matau volunteered to go back to the surface and bring back six squads of Vahki. They will take the tunnels apart, stone by stone. You know nothing can hide from them."</p>
			<p>"No, of course not," Nuju said softly. "How long ago did he leave?"</p>
			<p>"Not long," said Onewa. "But he travels fast."</p>
			<p>Nuju turned and started to walk away. Vakama put a hand on his shoulder. "Where are you going?"</p>
			<p>"Matau does not inspire a great deal of confidence," the Toa of Ice replied. "The Vahki may not listen to him. I am going to join him, and together we will-"</p>
			<p>"I'm not surprised," said Nokama. "You are the one who is always talking about the virtues of teamwork, after all. How Toa Metru should always stay together and what folly it is for one to go off alone."</p>
			<p>"Exactly," Nuju nodded. "I will be back once I have found Matau and we have completed our mission."</p>
			<p>This time, Vakama let Nuju go a few steps. Then Matau suddenly dropped from the ceiling, landing right on top of the stunned Toa of Ice. "No need to quick-hurry! I am here. And so are you, Krahka."</p>
			<p>Matau pinned the Krahka to the floor. She snarled and squirmed, but the Toa of Air's grip would not be broken. Finally, the creature gave up the struggle and simply stared at her captors, with a mix of anger and respect in her eyes.</p>
			<p>"Very clever," the Krahka said. "Here I just finished telling someone you were too trusting."</p>
			<p>"There's a difference between trusting and stupid," replied Vakama. "We suspected you might try to deceive us again, so we set a trap of our own. And for your information, Nuju would rather shovel out Ussal crab stalls than take a long journey with Matau."</p>
			<p>The Toa of Air hauled the Krahka to her feet, saying, "That's right. You underestimated how much Nuju cannot stand to be around..." His voice trailed off as he realized what he was saying.</p>
			<p>"Now you are going to take us to Whenua and Nuju," Onewa said to their captive. "No tricks. No transformations."</p>
			<p>The Krahka said nothing in response, but the mask she wore smiled. Then her entire body began to shimmer and fade, as the Toa for the first time watched her change forms. In an instant, "Nuju" was gone, replaced by a monstrous lava eel. Matau jumped back with a cry as the skin of the creature turned blazing hot.</p>
			<p>Free now, the Krahka slithered rapidly into a tunnel, leaving behind a scorched and smoking trail.</p>
			<p>"Mata Nui," whispered Nokama. "How...how do we stop something that can do that?"</p>
			<p>"I don't know," said Vakama. "But for the sake of Whenua and Nuju, we had better find a way."</p>
			<p>The four Toa Metru followed the trail of the Krahka/lava eel for a long distance, before it suddenly vanished. Evidently tiered of that form, the Krahka had switched to another that left no trace.</p>
			<p>"Now how do we find her?" asked Vakama, frustrated.</p>
			<p>"Maybe by <i>not</i> seek-finding her," said Matau. "Make sense?"</p>
			<p>Onewa smiled. "Yes. It does. If we were to find an exit to the Archives-"</p>
			<p>"She would have to do something to stop us," Nokama concluded. "You saw how she reacted to the thought of Vahki down here. She can't afford to let us escape. But how do we find a hatch in this maze?"</p>
			<p>"We don't," said Onewa. "We make one. And we make lots of noise doing it."</p>
			<p>Finding a spot with a relatively low celing, the Toa set to work. Vakama used some of his fading power to soften the stone, and then the other three went to work with their tools. It was slow going and there was no way to know how many feet of rock they would have to go through to reach the Archives. But none of them expected they would be allowed to complete the job anyway.</p>
			<p>Vakama was the first to notice something unusual. Out of the corner of his eye, he thought he saw a shadow move. He turned to get a better look. It wasn't a shadow, but a long tendril of black smoke snaking into the tunnel. It was followed by another and another, until it looked like some dark, tentacled beast floating in the air.</p>
			<p>"She's here," he said very quietly to the others. All of them kept working as if they had not noticed anything. It was a risky strategy. If the Krahka had come to defeat them once and for all, allowing her to strike first would be a colossal mistake. But if there was a possibility she would take them back to her lair, where Nuju and Whenua would be waiting, then it was a risk they had to take.</p>
			<p>Moving with the speed of an angry swarm of Nui-Rama insects, the tendrils wrapped themselves around the Toa. Each was enveloped in black smoke, able to breathe but not to see, hear, or move. Then came a sensation of weightlessness, as the Krahka lifted the Toa into the air and sent them floating through the tunnels.</p>
			<p>If she could have, the Krahka would have smiled over the ease of her victory. But monsters made of smoke don't have mouths to smile with, so her celebration would have to wait until she had changed forms once more. This thought did not bother her. After all, with the Toa Metru her helpless prisoners, she had all the time in the world.</p>
			<p><i>Too bad the Toa cannot say the same,</i> she said to herself.</p>
			<h2>10</h2>
			<p>The Toa Metru found themselves dumped on a cold stone floor like so many broken masks. They looked around to see they were in the same chamber where Whenua and now Nuju were held. The creature of smoke had disappeared, to be replaced by the form of Nokama.</p>
			<p>"I do not like these bodies," the Krahka said. "But Rahkshi do not have the ability to speak your language. And I think it only right that you should know your fate."</p>
			<p>"Why must we be enemies?" asked Vakama. "We came down here only to-"</p>
			<p>"You came down to invade my home!" snapped the Krahka. "Just like all the other top-dwellers, with your drills, and your scraping tools, and your fires. Now I know that as long as there are dwellers up above, there will be no peace here."</p>
			<p>The Nokama/Krahka's right arm suddenly shifted to a long, leather-scaled limb with nasty claws. "Have you ever seen the creature this belongs to? No, of course not. This Rahi produces a living crystal to weave its nest, a crystal that regenerates when damaged. In a few moments, I will use that crystal to seal off the exits to this chamber."</p>
			<p>Then, still in Nokama's gentle voice, the Krahka added, "You six will remain here forever."</p>
			<p>"There's an entire city up there," said Onewa. "Thousands of Matoran. Six Toa more or less won't stop them from coming down to these tunnels."</p>
			<p>"But I want them to come," the Krahka hissed. "I want them all to come. Oh, at first I thought I could use your forms to keep them away, but now I realize that's a foolish idea. Better to lure them all down below the surface...and imprison them here...then make the land above my new home."</p>
			<p>The Krahka's body began to shift into the form of a massive, hideous Rahi. As her head changed from Nokama's to the creature's, she said, "You cannot stop me. I have all your powers, all your skills. Accept your defeat, Toa Metru."</p>
			<p>Fully transformed, the Krahka slithered away to begin sealing the first exit. Nokama turned to Onewa and whispered, "She may be right. She possesses our powers at full strength, while our energies are low."</p>
			<p>"I might have an idea, but it needs all six of us to make it work," said the Toa of Stone. "I can free Nuju, given time, but what about Whenua?"</p>
			<p>Matau pointed up to where the Toa of Earth was trapped. "I think he is quick-solving the problem for us. Look."</p>
			<p>High above, Whenua had been working on his bonds tirelessly. The combination of his efforts and the intense heat from the protodermis pool down below had weakened the strands until they began to detach from the ceiling. Soon, they would be unable to support his weight. Of course, the bad news was that freedom would send him plummeting into molten protodermis.</p>
			<p>"Any disks left?" Onewa asked Vakama.</p>
			<p>"One. Not sure what good it will do against a shapeshifter, though."</p>
			<p>"When Whenua falls, launch it. Matau?"</p>
			<p>The Toa of Air had already readied his tools. At his mental signal, they would carry him into the air. He gestured up, across, and down to tell Onewa his plan.</p>
			<p>"Can your hydro blades crack rock?" Vakama asked Nokama.</p>
			<p>"Just watch them. Get ready."</p>
			<p>Whenua had loosed his restraints enough to brace his feet against the ceiling. Now he gave one final shove and tore his bonds loose. The instant he saw the Toa of Earth begin to fall, Matau rocketed into the air.</p>
			<p>Vakama loaded and launched in one smooth motion. The disk struck the Krahka and unleashed its power to reconstitute at random. The Rahi bellowed with rage as her body went through multiple changes at once, arms and legs shifting rapidly from one form to another.</p>
			<p>Onewa and Nokama moved so fast it almost looked as if they had been hurled from a launcher as well. They vaulted over the protodermis pool and struck Nuju's stone prison as one. Onewa's knowledge of stone served him well, as his proto pitons found just the right weak point to hit. The rock cracked down the middle and fell apart, freeing the Toa of Ice.</p>
			<p>Up above, Matau caught Whenua before he had fallen too far. Rather than fight to stay aloft carrying the extra weight, the Toa of Air went into a power dive, heading right for the Krahka. But the Rahi spotted the danger and used Vakama's powers to throw up a wall of flame in their path.</p>
			<p>The Toa of Fire had no time to think, only to act. He flung out his arms and strained to absorb the fire into him. If he failed, Whenua and Matau were doomed.</p>
			<p>Nokama, Onewa, and Nuju watched from the other side of the chamber, knowing they were helpless to aid him. Matau and Whenua were only seconds from plunging into the flames.</p>
			<p>Where Vakama found the strength of will, he would never know. But suddenly the flames began to whirl like a cyclone and shot across the room into the Toa of Fire. Glowing with power, he unleashed them again at the wall behind the Krahka, blasting it into rubble.</p>
			<p>"Try sealing that up," he shouted.</p>
			<p>Rattled by the explosion, the Krahka could not get out of the way of the diving Toa. But she transformed by reflex into a gelatinous creature, and Whenua and Matau shot right through her and landed hard on the floor. The Krahka shifted again, this time into a purple Rahkshi, then let out a scream.</p>
			<p>The force of the yell knocked the Toa off their feet. Vakama, drained from his efforts against the wall of flame, flew halfway across the chamber. Matau and Whenua tried to rise, but a second scream slammed them into the wall.</p>
			<p>The Krahka's form changed once more, this time into the shape of Vakama. But she was clearly beginning to tire. "You...have no idea...what you are dealing with," she said. "There are things down here...things I have seen...that dwarf your power. If I become one, I could down you all with one blow and then crush your city."</p>
			<p>Vakama saw the Rahi wearing his form and heard the words coming out of "his" mouth. His rage overcame his weakness. He rose and began striding across the chamber toward the Krahka. "Then do it!" he shouted. "Show us your power, if you can!"</p>
			<p>Nokama started forward. "Vakama-"</p>
			<p>Nuju blocked her path. "No, let him speak. While her attention is on him, we can help Matau and Whenua. Then the Toa Metru will stand united."</p>
			<p>"And we know how much you like that," Onewa said, smiling at Nuju.</p>
			<p>"It has its place," was all the Toa of Ice said.</p>
			<p>Vakama had not slowed in his march toward the Rahi. The Krahka took a step backward, saying, "You think you can stand against my power? You are a fool, Toa of Fire!"</p>
			<p>"And you are a thief!" snapped Vakama. "Not a conqueror-just a pathetic creature who survives by stealing the might of others, because she has none of her own. Maybe you started out wanting only to protect your home, Krahka, but it has made you into a monster."</p>
			<p>The other Toa had thought Vakama was only trying to distract the Rahi. But as they moved to surround her, they saw he had not even noticed them. His attention and anger were focused on her, and hers on him.</p>
			<p>The Krahka shouted something in a language none had ever heard and launched beams of fire and ice at Vakama. Amazingly, he did not even try to dodge. It was as if the emotions inside him were acting as a shield against her powers.</p>
			<p>"You may defeat us all," he said. "You may defeat every Matoran and every Vahki in all of Metru Nui. But you will not do it looking like a Toa. You will not shame what a Toa stands for, or one who has fallen to protect our city. That I swear!"</p>
			<p>The Krahka looked around, finally noticing that the other five Toa were closing in. But she showed no fear or hesitation. Instead, she laughed and said, "Not as a Toa? Very well, then-"</p>
			<p>Now began the most amazing transformation of all. Before the horrified eyes of the Toa Metru, the Krahka grew and changed into a walking nightmare. No longer was she Vakama, or any single Toa. Now she towered above them as a frightening combination of all six.</p>
			<p>A fearsome face smiled down at them. Six arms slowly waved in the air as she grew accustomed to her new form. "Do you like this better, little ones?" she said, her voice the mingled voices of all the Toa Metru.</p>
			<p>"There's an exhibit for the Archives, librarian," said Onewa.</p>
			<p>"I don't think she will fit," Whenua replied. "Outside of running away, anyone have any good ideas?"</p>
			<p>"Spread out," said Vakama. "Let's not make it easy for her."</p>
			<p>"Are we escaping?" asked Whenua.</p>
			<p>"No," answered Nuju as he readied his crystal spikes. "We are ending this."</p>
			<p>"Ah," said Matau, aero slicers in his hands. "Well, I had no thought-plans for today, anyway."</p>
			<p>The Krahka watched with amusement as the Toa Metru took up positions around her. Every move she made in her new combined form filled the Toa with revulsion. But it was Nokama who first took a step forward.</p>
			<p>"Beware, Toa of Water," rumbled the Krahka. "Even you cannot withstand Vakama's flames."</p>
			<p>"No, I can't," Nokama agreed. "Can you? You have gone too far, Krahka. I think you know it, too. If you have our power, don't you have our wisdom as well? Does this have to end in battle?"</p>
			<p>"Yes! You must fall! The mask-makers must be driven from the Sculpture Fields. The knowledge crystals must not fly through the chutes. And...and the exhibits...they must be purified...and stored...so that the canals can flow..."</p>
			<p>The Krahka swayed, as the images and knowledge derived from six minds flooded her own. For a moment, it seemed as if it would be too much, and Nokama was certain victory was at hand. But the Krahka's will was too strong. She steadied herself again.</p>
			<p>"You would have lived out your lives here, safe from harm," the Krahka said, raising all six of her arms. "But now..."</p>
			<p>The Toa Metru knew what was coming. Their only hope was to move fast. Together, the heroes of Metru Nui charged.</p>
			<p>Raw power surged from within the Krahka. Bolts of ice and fire, storms of earth and stone, whirlpools of water and air rained down on the Toa. They struggled to make headway against their own power, only to be driven back. With their full energies, they might have achieved a stalemate. Weakened as they were, it seemed they could not win.</p>
			<p>Vakama, half frozen by Nuju's power, glanced up at the Krahka. He expected to see a creature aglow with triumph as she drove the Toa down. But instead the Krahka looked as if she were about to collapse.</p>
			<p>"Keep struggling!" he shouted to the other Toa. "Don't give in!"</p>
			<p>The Krahka unleashed more and more power. One by one, the Toa Metru fell before the onslaught, only to somehow find the strength to rise again. The Krahka's fury grew greater every moment, but all her might could not make the Toa surrender.</p>
			<p>Far below, the Toa struggled for their very lives. Nuju battled to make headwa against raging winds; Nokama leaped and dodged white-hot fireballs; Matau batted stones away with his aero slicers; Vakama pressed on through a howling blizzard; Onewa fought to overcome tidal waves of earth as Whenua did the same with water.</p>
			<p>The Toa of Water realized there was no way to overcome the Krahka with sheer might. The only hope for victory lay in striking out at the Rahi's willpower and weaken her from within.</p>
			<p>"I hope you win!" Nokama shouted at the Krahka. "It will be the fate you deserve!"</p>
			<p>The Krahka's attack did not slow, but she regarded the Toa with puzzlement.</p>
			<p>Nuju guessed Nokama's plan and decided it was a good one. "She's right!" he shouted over the wind. "At least if we are trapped here, we will be together. You will be alone for eternity, Krahka."</p>
			<p>Nokama barely dodged the hottest fireball yet. "I've seen how Rahkshi are around you. They fear you, just like everything else down here. They know you for a deceiver."</p>
			<p>"The Rahi will flee Metru Nui," Onewa added. "You will be the absolute ruler of...nothing."</p>
			<p>The Krahka did not take this suggestion well. She began combining her powers in one blast, using earth and water to bury Onewa in a sea of mud. Nokama needed all her agility to avoid molten rock. Vakama faced a blizzard of snow, ice, and stone.</p>
			<p>"We will build a new city-home down here," said Matau. "But even in the sun's light, monster, you will always be in night-dark!"</p>
			<p>"You are trying to confuse me!" bellowed the Krahka. "It will not work!"</p>
			<p>Whenua could see she was lying. Better still, she was expending huge amounts of power as she grew more agitated. Onewa had told him something of how the Krahka had used his form to fool the Toa, so Whenua decided it was time for payback.</p>
			<p>Fighting the crushing might of the water, he bent down and activated his earthshock drills. Their sound could not be heard over the winds in the chamber. He swiftly dug a hole and dove into it, followed by the waters. If he was right, this maneuver would shake the Krahka up even more. If he was wrong, there would only be five Toa left to fight.</p>
			<p>The massive Rahi noticed immediately that Whenua was gone. "Where? Where is the Toa of Earth?" she demanded, casting her eyes about frantically.</p>
			<p>The stone floor behind the Krahka exploded. Whenua's head emerged from the hole. "Surprise!" he yelled. "See what a real Toa of Earth can do, not some cheap imitation!"</p>
			<p>Whenua vanished underground again. Enraged, the Krahka melted the stone around the hole, all the while continuing to fend off the other five Toa.</p>
			<p>Down below, the Toa of Earth fought to hold his breath as his drills carved through the stone. If he was right the Krahka was just above him, and about to get a shock.</p>
			<p>The Krahka felt the ground give way beneath her and struggled to keep her balance. She would not fall before these...these interlopers! She would crush them here and now, and then all top-dwellers, and she would rule above! But...who would she rule? Mindless Rahi? And what would she have them do?</p>
			<p>No, it didn't matter. They would obey her commands. And her first command would be to...to...</p>
			<p>But what if they all fled her approach? Then she would stop them. She would imprison them in the city, just like she had done the top-dwellers. She would cage everything that existed-only that way could she be sure of her own survival.</p>
			<p>As her inner debate raged, the Toa were able to make progress against her weakening powers. Onewa could sense that the end was near, if only one more event would push her over the edge. He signaled for the Toa to move closer together and form a wedge, forcing the Krahka to focus maximum power on one spot.</p>
			<p>Reacting to their maneuver, the Krahka pointed her six arms all in one direction and brought the powers bursts near to each other. At the crucial moment, Whenua tore out of the ground behind her, his shout of rage breaking her concentration. The elemental energies she wielded merged together in that one instant into one awesome blast.</p>
			<p>The Toa narrowly ducked the power beam. Only Vakama turned to see that where it struck a new substance had formed, one that looked like solid protodermis. <i>How could that be?</i> he wondered. <i>Is that what would result if we combined our powers?</i> Maybe-</p>
			<p>"Vakama, watch out!" Nokama shouted.</p>
			<p>Then, without warning, the power ceased to flow from the hands of the Krahka. The giant Rahi staggered and fell, slamming into the ground with such force that surely all of Metru Nui must have trembled. She lay still, her body slowly beginning another transformation, but into what, none could tell.</p>
			<p>Vakama approached the prone form. "She still lives. Trying to use all our powers at once overwhelmed her. It is over...for now."</p>
			<p>"Yes, for now," said Nokama. "But what cage could hope to hold a creature that can transform at will?"</p>
			<p>"The Onu-Matoran can put her in stasis," offered Whenua. "She can be kept in the Archives until it is safe, someday, to release her."</p>
			<p>"And if there are more like her down here?" said Onewa.</p>
			<p>"That is the Toa of Stone," said Matau. "Always with the happy-cheer."</p>
			<p>"No!" groaned the Krahka. "No...I will not be...chained!"</p>
			<p>The Toa whirled to see their opponent had shifted to the form of a lava eel once more. Only Vakama was close enough to stop her, but he did not move as she plunged into the pool of molten protodermis. The others ran to the edge of the pool, but there was no sign of her.</p>
			<p>"Why didn't you stop her?" demanded Onewa. "You just let her go!"</p>
			<p>"She fought to protect her home. But too much power, funneled by too much anger, made her a menace," Vakama said quietly. "Perhaps I saw a reflection of ourselves in her...of what we could become, if we are not very careful."</p>
			<p>Onewa threw up his hands. "Someday, I will figure you out, fire-spitter. But not today, it seems."</p>
			<p>Nokama stared at the molten pool for a long time. Had Vakama done the right thing? The Krahka was no unthinking beast, but she did have a great deal to learn before she could live in peace with others. Still, could any being hope to master such lessons in a cage? The Toa of Water could not say for sure. But one question more haunted her...With its power to change shapes, if the Krahka did survive and someday returned...how would they know?</p>
			<h2>Epilogue</h2>
			<p>His tale finished, Turaga Vakama sat down. Tahu Nuva was the first to speak. "I see that the shape of victory was perhaps not so easy to recognize on Metru Nui, as it has been here. Still, I am sure the Matoran applauded your achievements."</p>
			<p>Vakama shook his head. "They were never to hear this story, Toa of Fire. We sealed the cracks we had come to find, then departed from the tunnels. On the way, we decided that it would serve no purpose to share our experiences with others. Whenua offered to warn the Matoran to be careful where they dug in the future, to avoid harming the natural life below."</p>
			<p>"But if it was a menace-?" said Kopaka Nuva.</p>
			<p>"It was defending its home against an invader, much as you did against the Bohrok," replied Vakama. "Now that it knew that one could not hope to defeat six, it would not threaten the surface world again. Or so we believed..."</p>
			<p>"That, then, is the lesson of this tale," said Hahli. "When the Toa stand together, no force can overcome them."</p>
			<p>Vakama gave the Chronicler a smile of approval. "Very good. That is half the lesson learned. What is the rest?"</p>
			<p>Hahli had no answer. The Toa Nuva looked at each other, equally puzzled. Finally, Lewa spoke up. "Stay topside. The underground is a nasty-dark place."</p>
			<p>The Toa Nuva-even Kopaka-had to smile at that. Vakama chucked and said, "No, Toa of Air, although there is truth in that as well. We learned it is not enough just to trust-one must trust wisely. Nuju trusted the sight of Nokama and so wound up in an embrace of stone. The Krahka took our friendship and our reliance upon each other and used it as a tool against us."</p>
			<p>The Turaga of Fire leaned forward and spoke with quiet urgency. "Trust not in what you see and hear, Toa Nuva. Trust in what your mind and heart tell you. That is something which, even after this adventure, the Toa Metru had still not grasped completely."</p>
			<p>Vakama's expression turned grim. "And it is a lesson that cost us dearly. Very dearly."</p>
			<p>"So what happened next?" asked Jaller. "Did you ever make it to the Coliseum? Were you recognized as heroes?"</p>
			<p>"After we emerged from the tunnels, we decided to return to our own metru briefly to ensure our Matoran friends were safe. We also needed to secure some of the loose ends of our old lives before leaving them behind forever. Those are stories for another day. But, yes, we did finally come to the Coliseum to present ourselves to Turaga Dume and the Matoran assembled."</p>
			<p>"And-?" asked Takanuva, Toa of Light, eagerly.</p>
			<p>"I can see you will not be content until you have heard my tale in full," Vakama said softly. "Very well, my friends. I will share with you the legends of Metru Nui..."</p>
			<p>The Turaga would talk long into the night, recalling for the Toa Nuva a world they had never known.</p>

			<h1>BIONICLE Adventures #4: Legends of Metru Nui</h1>
			<h3>Greg Farshtey</h3>
			<h2>Introduction</h2>
			<p>Turaga Vakama stood on a natural stone balcony that looked out over a vast silver sea. Directly in front of him was an Amaja circle, the sand pit used by Turaga for ages to tell stories of the past. Now, surrounded by his fellow Turaga, the Matoran villagers, the six Toa Nuva and Takanuva, Toa of Light, he was about to tell the most important tale of all.</p>
			<p>"Gathered friends," he began. "Listen again to our legend of the Bionicle. In the time before time, in the glorious city of Metru Nui, we believed new heroes could not be made."</p>
			<p>"But we were wrong."</p>
			<p>Vakama moved the stone that represented the Great Spirit, Mata Nui, to the center of the circle. Now the lightstones began to flicker and darkness shrouded the sand pit.</p>
			<p>"An unrelenting shadow sought to enforce endless sleep," Vakama continued, "until memories of times past were lost. Then he could create a time of dark order, and awaken the world as its conqueror."</p>
			<p>Vakama raised his eyes to the heavens, remembering a time long ago. "Hope, it seemed, was lost."</p>
			<h2>1</h2>
			<p>Toa Lhikan, guardian of the city of Metru Nui, stood in the semi-darkness of the Great Temple. He had come here many times in the past to remember what had gone before and reflect on the future. This had always been a place that had soothed his spirit. But not today.</p>
			<p>The errand that had brought him to one of the most revered sites in Metru Nui was one that filled him with sadness and doubt. Many a night he had wondered if there might be some other way, but no other answer presented itself. Finally, he admitted that he had no choice. It had to be done, and done now, before it was too late.</p>
			<p>Grimly, Lhikan pried open the suva. Then he reached in and took the sixth and last Toa stone off its pedestal.</p>
			<p>As he had done five times before, Toa Lhikan placed the stone on a thin sheet of metallic protodermis in his open palm. Then he clenched his fist, wrapping the sheet tightly around the stone.</p>
			<p>Behind his yellow Great Mask of Shielding, Lhikan's eyes narrowed. He knew that he was doing far more than taking valuable objects of power. He was taking a step that would change his life, the lives of six others, and the very future of Metru Nui.</p>
			<p>He held his other hand over his closed fist and concentrated. Six streams of energy came from his hand, then merged into a single white lance of power. It flowed over the wrapped Toa stone, then abruptly came to a stop. When Lhikan opened his fist, he saw that the metallic sheet was now sealed around the stone. Imprinted on it was the symbol of the three virtues of the Matoran: Unity, Duty, and Destiny.</p>
			<p>Lhikan heard a soft sound behind him and turned quickly. Approaching from out of the darkness were two figures, one a four-legged insectoid being, the other a hulking brute. Lhikan knew all too well who they were and why they were here. He was already moving as the insectiod began hurling energy blasts.</p>
			<p>Fleeing was against Lhikan's nature, but he had been a Toa long enough to know it did not pay to challenge impossible odds. He ran, dodging as the two Dark Hunters attempted to snare him in energy webs. As they closed in, the Toa of Fire leaped through a window and plunged into space.</p>
			<p>The insectoid Dark Hunter rushed to the window to watch his enemy fall. Instead, he saw Lhikan combine his tools to form a glider board. Seconds later, the Toa was lost from view.</p>
			<p>Nokama stood near the Great Temple, surrounded by her students. As a teacher, she knew it was important to get her class out of the classroom now and then, and let them see some of Metru Nui's history for themselves. Using her trident, she pointed out some of the ancient carvings on the walls of the temple.</p>
			<p>Behind her, she could hear her students gasp. She turned to see Toa Lhikan. He approached her, handed her a small package, and then was gone. Nokama shook her head, wondering what it could all mean.</p>
			<p>In a Po-Metru assemblers' village, Onewa was hard at work finishing a piece of carving. He had been laboring in the heat all day, but hardly noticed the time or the effort. It was all worth it when the work was done and another fine display of craftsmanship was ready to ship out. He knew that each Po-Matoran crafter in the huts around him felt the same, except perhaps Ahkmou. That one seemed more worried about how many honors he would receive than how much work he finished.</p>
			<p>Something landed with a sharp thud on the ground at Onewa's feet. It was a small package wrapped in what looked like foil. Onewa looked up just in time to see the departing form of Toa Lhikan.</p>
			<p>	*	*	*</p>
			<p>Whenua was content. A new shipment of Bohrok had arrived at the Archives. As soon as he was done cataloging the creatures, they would be ready to go on exhibit for all Matoran to see.</p>
			<p>He worked quickly, sorting through the items in a pile of artifacts. Some were slated for immediate exhibit, others would be sent down to the sublevels, and still more were too damaged to be of any use. These would be sent to Ta-Metru to be melted down.</p>
			<p>Whenua was so absorbed by his work that he never heard Toa Lhikan's approach. The Toa paused only long enough to hand the Matoran a small object, then he was gone. Whenua looked in wonder at the package, whose covering glittered even in the dim light of the Archives.</p>
			<p>Matau took a deep breath. This was his favorite part of the job-testing new vehicles before they hit the streets of Le-Metru. He was, naturally, the best qualified to run them around the test track, being the most highly skilled rider in the entire metru...at least, in his opinion.</p>
			<p>Today's test vehicle was a one-Matoran moto-sled invented by an Onu-Matoran named Nuparu. He claimed it would someday replace the Ussal crabs that carried cargo to and fro in Metru Nui. Matau was less worried about that than about how fast it could go.</p>
			<p>When the signal was given, Matau worked the controls and the machine began to move. Soon it was racing around the test track. Matau smiled, certain that he could coax a little more speed out of Nuparu's machine. He reached out, grabbed one of the controls-and it broke off in his hadn.</p>
			<p>Matau's eyes went wide. <i>Oh, this is not happy-cheer at all,</i> he thought.</p>
			<p>All around him, pieces of the vehicle were flying off as the vehicle spun madly. Finally, only the control seat remained, with Matau hanging on to keep from being tossed the length of the track Sparks flew as the lone intact section skidded to a halt, while Matau leaped off at the last possible moment.</p>
			<p>The Matoran managed not to break anything on his landing. As he rose to his feet, he saw he was not alone. Toa Lhikan was standing beside him, offering him a gift. Then the Toa was gone.</p>
			<p>Matau looked at the small, heavy item in his hand. <i>Truly an ever-strange day,</i> he said to himself.</p>
			<p>Nuju peered through his telescope. From his vantage point high atop a Ko-Metru tower, he could see the sky, the stars, Toa Lhikan gliding toward him-</p>
			<p>Toa Lhikan?</p>
			<p>The lone protector of Metru Nui landed softly beside the Matoran. Without a word, he handed Nuju a wrapped Toa stone. Then, secure that the coast was clear, Lhikan leaped from the roof and surfed away on the wind.</p>
			<p>Nuju watched him go, wondering what this event might mean for the future.</p>
			<p>Vakama carefully moved a Kanoka disk from his worktable into the fires of the forge. He watched intently as the flames softened the disk. When he felt the time was right, he removed it from the heat and began to shape it with his firestaff. He smoothed the rough edges of the disk, added eyeholes, and then paused to look at the Mask of Power he had created.</p>
			<p>Far below him, a pool of molten protodermis bubbled and hissed. This was the raw material that was fed into the forge to be shaped into disks, and later into masks, if the grade of disk was high enough. All around was a series of interlocking catwalks, with a great crane suspended above the center of the molten vat.</p>
			<p>Vakama held the mask up to the light and searched for flaws in the workmanship. Finding none, he placed it on his face. Given that it was a Great Mask, he knew he would not be able to access its powers, but he could at least get a sense of whether it was active. But when he donned it, it merely glowed dimly before flickering out.</p>
			<p>Disgusted, Vakama took it off and threw it on top of a huge pile of similar masks. At the rate he was going, his stack of failures would soon be taller than he was. Shaking his head, he turned to see Toa Lhikan standing before him.</p>
			<p>"Making Great Masks, Vakama?" asked the Toa.</p>
			<p>Vakama took a step backward and stumbled. "Toa Lhikan! Um, not yet...but with the right disk..."</p>
			<p>"The city needs your help," said Lhikan, reaching behind him to retrieve something. A moment later Vakama saw it was a small package wrapped in a shiny material.</p>
			<p>"My help?" the Matoran said, taking another step backward. He bumped into the discard pile, causing the rejected masks to clatter to the floor.</p>
			<p>"Matoran are vanishing," Lhikan continued urgently. "Deceit lurks in the shadows of Metru Nui."</p>
			<p>"Toa-so dramatic."</p>
			<p>Both Lhikan and Vakama turned at the voice. A large, four-legged, insectoid creature stood inside the foundry. "Always playing the hero," the creature hissed.</p>
			<p>"Some of us take our duty seriously, Nidhiki," growled Lhikan. Then he turned to Vakama, gestured to the package, and whispered, "Keep it safe. Get to the Great Temple."</p>
			<p>Nidhiki raised his claws. "This time your farewell will be forever, brother."</p>
			<p>"You lost the right to call me brother long ago," said Lhikan.</p>
			<p>Nidhiki spat blasts of dark energy. Lhikan narrowly evaded them, but one surge of energy struck the support for the catwalk, shearing through it. Lhikan was considering his next move when there came a crash from above. He looked up to see a mammoth form falling toward him.</p>
			<p>"Time's up, Toa!" bellowed the plummeting figure.</p>
			<p>Nidhiki smiled as his bestial partner, Krekka, crashed onto the catwalk beside Lhikan. Immediately, Toa and Dark Hunter began to grapple. Krekka's size and strength gave him the edge, but in Lhikan he faced the veteran of a thousand conflicts. The Toa waited for the right moment, then sidestepped and used Krekka's force against him. With one smooth motion, Lhikan tossed Krekka over the side of the catwalk.</p>
			<p>The Dark Hunter might not have been the brightest being in Metru Nui, but even he knew what would happen if he landed in a vat of molten protodermis. His hand shot out and grabbed onto the edge of the catwalk, and he began to pull himself back up.</p>
			<p>Lhikan glanced toward Vakama. The Matoran had been watching the struggle, so frozen with shock that he had not noticed the damage done by Nidhiki's earlier blast. But Lhikan could see that the catwalk on which Vakama stood was about to collapse.</p>
			<p>"Vakama! Move!" he shouted.</p>
			<p>It was already too late. Metal groaned and snapped and the catwalk broke free of its supports, sending Vakama sliding toward molten doom. Ignoring the threat of Nidhiki, Lhikan jumped to the broken platform and grabbed hold of the Matoran.</p>
			<p>Nidhiki's eyes narrowed. "Compassion was always your weakness, brother," he said.</p>
			<p>Lhikan struggled to haul Vakama back up to relative safety. Then he suddenly felt himself seized and lifted into the air. The Toa turned to see that Krekka had taken control of the crane, and it was that which now dangled Lhikan and Vakama over the bubbling vat. "It's swim time!" snarled Krekka.</p>
			<p>The Dark Hunter shifted the controls and began to lower the crane toward the vat. Lhikan summoned all his strength, and hoisted Vakama high so the Matoran could grab onto the clawlike end of the crane. "Don't let go," the Toa ordered.</p>
			<p>"Wasn't planning to," Vakama replied.</p>
			<p>That had been the easy part. Now Toa Lhikan started to swing his body back and forth like a pendulum, trying to build up enough force to execute his only possible plan. He didn't think about what would happen if he failed, or about the molten substance waiting below-his entire focus was on the timing and speed of his swing.</p>
			<p>At the crucial moment, Lhikan let go of the crane and went sailing through the air. He landed on top of the machine's cab, much to the surprise of Krekka. Before the Dark Hunter could react, Lhikan had shouldered him aside and stopped the crane's descent.</p>
			<p>The Toa had no chance to celebrate his triumph. An energy web launched by Nidhiki wrapped around Lhikan, trapping him. As he struggled in vain to escape, his eyes locked on the Matoran.</p>
			<p>"Vakama, the Great Spirit depends on you!" he cried. "Save the heart of Metru Nui!"</p>
			<p>Krekka released an arc of dark energy that bound the Toa's hands, but Vakama could no longer see. His mind had been overtaken by a vision of the future...</p>
			<p><i>Time slowing, slowing, almost coming to a stop. A face coming closer, but obscured by waves of elemental energy. Now it became clearer...it was Lhikan...but twisted and distorted...and behind him, a pair of red eyes that radiated pure evil...</i></p>
			<p>The horrifying sight snapped Vakama out of his trance, but left him weak and trembling. He glanced around dazedly, and was just in time to see Lhikan being dragged off by Krekka and Nidhiki. "Time is short!" yelled Lhikan. "Stop the darkness!"</p>
			<p>"No!" Vakama shouted. For, in truth, there was nothing else he could do.</p>
			<h2>2</h2>
			<p>Near the Fountains of Wisdom in Ga-Metru, scores of Matoran looked up at a massive screen. The wise, beneveolent mask of Turaga Dume, elder of the city, gazed down upon them. None paid any attention to the transport that crawled by on insectoid legs. Driven by Vahki Bordakh, it carried several large, silver spheres.</p>
			<p>"Matoran of Metru Nui," Dume began, his voice and image carried all over the city. "It is with deep sorrow that I must inform you of the disappearance of our beloved Toa Lhikan."</p>
			<p>In Ko-Metru, Ta-Metru, and all around the city, Matoran gasped. Those who attempted to approach the screen, or turn away from it, were stopped by Vahki squads.</p>
			<p>"But with the help of the Vahki," Dume continued, "order shall be maintained. Trust in me and soon all your concerns will be laid to rest."</p>
			<p>The Turaga's words felt like hot irons to Vakama. Back in his forge, he was looking at the package Lhikan had given to him.</p>
			<p>"Toa Lhikan...I failed you," he said sadly. He undid the foil wrapping to find he was holding a Toa stone. It was then he noticed the writing on the metal wrapping, but before he could examine it more closely-</p>
			<p>"You should not blame yourself, Vakama."</p>
			<p>The Matoran turned to see Turaga Dume entering, flanked by a squad of Vahki. A good mask-height taller than Vakama, Dume radiated wisdom and a paternal feeling for all Matoran. But the Vahki close by were a constant reminder that Dume was <i>the</i> authority in Metru Nui and his words were to be obeyed.</p>
			<p>Dume looked around at the chaos left in the wake of Lhikan's struggle with the Dark Hunters. "You are a mask-maker, not a Toa," he said gently.</p>
			<p>Vakama nodded. While Dume was looking away, he slipped the Toa stone and its wrapping onto the already cluttered table behind him. Certain it was well hidden, he went to get a chair for Dume, only to get his feet tangled and stumble to the ground.</p>
			<p>"I have come for the Mask of Time," said Dume.</p>
			<p>Vakama scrambled to his feet. "Yes, ah, well...I am sorry, Turaga. It's not yet ready. Great Masks take time to craft."</p>
			<p>"Perhaps you are using inferior disks."</p>
			<p>"I use the finest quality available, Turaga. Only Great Disks are more pure, but they can only be retrieved by a Toa."</p>
			<p>Dume turned away. "Of course. Pity Toa Lhikan is not here to help."</p>
			<p>Vakama turned and bumped the table, knocking the Toa stone off. Only swift movement let him catch it and conceal it again before Dume turned back to him.</p>
			<p>"Bring the completed mask to the Coliseum before the great contest," the Turaga ordered. "The destiny of Metru Nui rests in your hands."</p>
			<p>Vakama allowed himself a sigh of relief as the Turaga and his Vahki departed. As soon as they were out of sight, he went back to the metal wrapping. On closer examination he could see the writing on it was a detailed map-a map of a place every Matoran knew well.</p>
			<p>"The Great Temple..." Vakama whispered.</p>
			<p>As soon as he was able, Vakama slipped away and journeyed to Ga-Metru. But when he arrived at the Great Temple, he found to his surprise that there were other Matoran there as well. Five of them, in fact, and all strangers to him.</p>
			<p>Matau looked at Vakama up and down and said, "Fire-spitter? Did you wrong-turn?"</p>
			<p>"You tell me," Vakama replied, opening his hand to reveal the Toa stone he carried.</p>
			<p>Nokama stepped forward and showed that she, too, had a Toa stone. Each of the other Matoran did the same. "It seems we are all recipients of Toa Lhikan's gifts. All similar, yet each unique."</p>
			<p>"Like us!" said Matau, smiling. "All Matoran-some just more handsome than the rest."</p>
			<p>Whenua shook his head. "Who's ever heard of Matoran getting summoned to the Great Temple like this?"</p>
			<p>"What will be asked of us?" added Nuju. "We are all just...strangers."</p>
			<p>"Some stranger than others," said Onewa.</p>
			<p>Nokama gave the Po-Matoran a sharp look. "Your negativity pollutes this sanctuary, builder."</p>
			<p>"Save the lessons for your class, teacher," Onewa spat back.</p>
			<p>Their argument was interrupted by the sudden appearance of a stone shrine, which rose out of the floor in front of them. "The Toa Suva!" exclaimed Vakama.</p>
			<p>"When Toa realize their full potential, this suva shrine grants them their elemental powers," Whenua recited from memory.</p>
			<p>Each of the Matoran stepped forward and placed their Toa stone in a niche in the suva. A beam of elemental energy shot from the assembled stones. The temple chamber shook as if a great earthquake had struck the city. Then, as suddenly as it began, the tremors came to a stop.</p>
			<p>The Matoran looked at one another, bewildered, as the image of Toa Lhikan's mask appeared in the energy beam. The yellow Kanohi Hau hovered in the air.</p>
			<p>"Faithful Matoran, Metru Nui needs you," the Hau said, speaking in Lhikan's voice. "A shadow threatens its heart. Prove yourselves worthy Toa and fear not. The Great Spirit will guide you in ways you could not imagine."</p>
			<p>The mask glowed blindingly bright. The Matoran staggered as beams of energy shot from the mask, bathing them in unimaginable power. The Matoran began to glow, then change. Their bodies grew taller and stronger, armor forming where none had been before. Their masks transformed from the simple Kanohi of Matoran into Great Masks of Power.</p>
			<p>The hovering mask, now a bright ball of light, suddenly winked out. No sign of its presence remained, not even the Toa stones. The six Matoran-now six armored Toa Metru-looked at themselves and each other in awe.</p>
			<p>"Are we...Toa?" asked Onewa, excitement in his voice.</p>
			<p>"If we appear to be Toa-heroes, then we are Toa-heroes!" answered Matau.</p>
			<p>Whenua shook his head. "Since when are Matoran just zapped into Toa?"</p>
			<p>"When uncertain times lie ahead," suggested Nuju.</p>
			<p>Onewa looked around. "Now all we need are-"</p>
			<p>As if in answer, the sides of the raised suva fell away to reveal a cache of Toa tools. "These!" shouted Matau.</p>
			<p>The six new Toa rushed over to choose their equipment. Onewa grabbed a pair of proto pitons, Nuju twin crystal spikes, and Whenua earthshock drills. Vakama pondered for a moment before taking a disk launcher for himself.</p>
			<p>"Nice choice...for playing Matoran games, mask-maker," chuckled Matau.</p>
			<p>Nokama chose a pair of hydro blades, even as Matau began practicing with his aero slicers. He executed a series of rapid maneuvers with the sharp tools, shouting, "Oh yeah!" Halfway through a particularly complicated exercise, one of the blades flew from his hand and narrowly missed the new Toa Metru of Water.</p>
			<p>"Need I remind you," snapped Nokama, "this is about honoring our responsibilities to the Great Spirit?"</p>
			<p>"Nokama is right," agreed Whenua. "Mask-maker, you saw Toa Lhikan last, right?"</p>
			<p>When Vakama nodded, Nuju said, "What did he say we could expect?"</p>
			<p>Hesitantly, Vakama took a step forward. "He said..." the Toa Metru of Fire whispered.</p>
			<p>"Speak up, fire-spitter!" said Onewa.</p>
			<p>"He told me to stop the darkness...that I had to save the heart of Metru Nui," Vakama replied. "Then the Dark Hunters took him away...it was because of me."</p>
			<p>Vakama stopped speaking. His thoughts had turned inward as another vision overtook him.</p>
			<p><i>Shadows criss-crossed the landscape. Vakama was leading a group of figures toward Metru Nui, when there was a bright flash. It illuminated a city in ruins! Stunned, Vakama moved forward, only to see the city suddenly restored before his eyes.</i></p>
			<p><i>Six Kanoka disks flew toward him. Vakama ducked and dodged to avoid being struck, but the disks were not trying to harm him. Instead, they merged together to form one huge disk before bursting brilliantly into-</i></p>
			<p>Then Vakama was back with the other Toa. Though the vision was gone, he was still shielding his eyes from the flash of light. Onewa looked at him and said, "All that smelting must have cooked his head."</p>
			<p>"I saw it!" Vakama said frantically. "Metru Nui was destroyed! The six Great Kanoka Disks were headed right for me."</p>
			<p>"Thanks for dream-sharing," said Matau, making no effort to keep the doubt out of his voice.</p>
			<p>"Finding them would prove to Turaga Dume we are worthy Toa," insisted Vakama.</p>
			<p>"Well, according to ancient legend, one Great Disk is hidden in each metru," said Whenua.</p>
			<p>"So we go on a scavenger hunt because a fire-spitter stood too long in front of his forge?" sneered Onewa.</p>
			<p>"Visions can be a sign of madness," said Nokama. "Or messages from the Great Spirit. But as Toa, we cannot afford to ignore them."</p>
			<p>When no one spoke, she continued. "Then it is agreed. Each will recover the Great Disk from our own metru and present it to Turaga Dume."</p>
			<p>Onewa looked at Vakama and muttered, "I am doing this for Lhikan. No one else."</p>
			<p>Nokama led the Toa Metru deeper into the temple. On one wall was an ancient carving that the Toa of Water said contained clues to the locations of the six Great Disks.</p>
			<p>"The Great Disks will be found by seeking the unfamiliar within the familiar..." she read.</p>
			<p><i>In Po-Metru, you must seek a mountain in balance...</i></p>
			<p>High above the Sculpture Fields of Po-Metru, Onewa, Toa of Stone, wrestled to free the Great Disk. The disk was embedded in a huge, triangular slab of protodermis that was delicately balanced on one point. With a mighty heave, he freed the disk-and the slab began to topple toward him...</p>
			<p><i>In Ko-Metru, find where the sky and ice are joined...</i></p>
			<p>Nuju, Toa of Ice, slid down a steep incline, headed for a very long fall. As he flew off the edge of the Knowledge Tower roof, Nuju grabbed on to a huge icicle that hung from the ledge. That was when he noticed that this icicle was most unusual.</p>
			<p>Frozen inside it was a Great Disk.</p>
			<p><i>The Great Disk of Le-Metru will be all around you when you find it...</i></p>
			<p>Matau, Toa of Air, was in the one place he always hoped to avoid: inside a magnetic force sphere hurtling through a Le-Matoran transport chute toward certain destruction. But the sphere, which absorbed any debris around it, had also captured the Great Disk and unless Matau retrieved it, the disk would be shattered.</p>
			<p><i>Some days, being a Toa-hero is not all it's cracked up to be,</i> he said to himself.</p>
			<p><i>No door must be left unopened in Onu-Metru...</i></p>
			<p>Whenua struggled to slam a door in the Archives. The angry mutant Ussal crab on the other side had other ideas, though. Its massive claw snapped, trying to trap the Toa of Earth in its pincers. Not for the first time, Whenua wished that they would put signs on the doors of the exhibit rooms in this living museum.</p>
			<p>Using all of his Toa strength, Whenua succeeded in shutting and locking the massive door. He looked at the Great Disk in his hand and hoped that in the end all this struggle would be worth it.</p>
			<p><i>In Ga-Metru, go beyond the depths of any Toa before...</i></p>
			<p>Nokama swam through the protodermis sea with smooth, easy strokes. She had successfully wrestled the Great Disk from between two jagged outcroppings and now was headed to the surface with it.</p>
			<p>She had been so excited about finding it that she never noticed that the two "outcroppings" were teeth...or that a huge creature from the ocean's depths was now closing in on her...</p>
			<p><i>Embrace the root of fire in Ta-Metru...</i></p>
			<p>Vakama hung suspended in a Ta-Metru fire pit, trapped in the grip of a blackened, twisted plant. In his hand he clutched a Great Disk...but just how he would make it out of the pit with disk intact, he could not imagine.</p>
			<p><i>And these glorious disks will be yours.</i></p>
			<p>After many adventures, both together and separately, the Toa Metru finally met outside the Coliseum. Each held the Great Disk from his or her own metru.</p>
			<p>Nokama looked at her fellow Toa Metru. "Any troubles?"</p>
			<p>The Toa looked at the ground, at the Coliseum, at anything but each other. "No," each mumbled in turn.</p>
			<p>Then they walked together toward the massive door of the Metru Nui Coliseum.</p>
			<h2>3</h2>
			<p>The Coliseum towered over the city. It stood at the junction of all six metru, so tall it looked as if it must touch the sky. The Coliseum was large enough to accomodate every Matoran in Metru Nui, and served as both an athletic arena and the power station for the entire city. Turaga Dume's chambers were also to be found in this imposing building. One side of the arena was dominated by a massive statue of Toa Lhika, the other by Dume's box.</p>
			<p>The Toa Metru entered the arena in the middle of a Kanoka Disk tournament. All around them Matoran surfed on disks, over the undulating floor trying to launch their Kanoka into hoops mounted high on the walls. When the players saw the visitors, they immediately ceased their game and moved aside. The floor of the arena settled back into its natural bowl shape.</p>
			<p>Great Disks held high, the Toa Metru moved into the middle of the stadium. Quietly at first, the crowd began to chant "Toa...Toa...Toa..." Then the word burst from them in a cheer that rocked the Coliseum.</p>
			<p>"Hello, Metru Nui!" Matau shouted, waving. Then he turned to the other Toa, saying, "I always wanted to loud-shout that!"</p>
			<p>From high in his box, Turaga Dume watched the arrival of the Toa with surprise. He was flanked by two Vahki Rorzakh from Onu-Metru, and his huge, powerful hawk, Nivawk, perched behind him.</p>
			<p>Dume leaned forward and said in disbelief, "Vakama?!" Regaining control of himself with some effort, he continued, "Matoran in the morning, Toa by afternoon. No wonder you have not yet completed the Mask of Time."</p>
			<p>"Forgive the delay, Turaga, but..." Vakama began.</p>
			<p>"One moment we're Matoran, the next we're power-jolted," shouted Matau, shaking his body to simulate the shock. "And Toa-masked!"</p>
			<p>Nokama held her Great Disk up, followed by the others, and said to Dume, "We present you the Great Kanoka Disks as proof of our Toa stature."</p>
			<p>"Toa must prove themselves with deeds, not simple gifts," Dume replied. Then, addressing the crowd, he said, "Matoran of Metru Nui! The Great Spirit has provided six new Toa who will undoubtedly demonstrate their worthiness on this field of honor!"</p>
			<p>The crowd cheered, but the Toa Metru just stood there, stunned. All that work to retrieve the Great Disks, and Turaga Dume rejected them? One by one, they handed the disks to Vakama, disappointment and scorn in their faces. This had been his idea, and it had not worked.</p>
			<p>"Catch this, fire-spitter," Onewa snapped.</p>
			<p>In the Coliseum's control box, Matoran busily worked a series of levers and switches. The Toa Metru could hear machinery grinding and clanking beneath their feet. Then Dume's face appeared on the giant screen overlooking the field.</p>
			<p>"Cross the Sea of Protodermis," he boomed, "and be honored as Toa!"</p>
			<p>The field began to move, shift, undulate beneath the Toa Metru. They struggled to keep their balance as wave after wave passed through the ground. Then a series of large, silver columns topped with razor-sharp points erupted randomly out of the field, threatening to skewer the Toa.</p>
			<p>Matau narrowly avoided the first thrust, saying, "Lucky I'm so quick-fast!" But that left Nuju in harm's way. The Toa Metru of Ice leaped back, crashing into Whenua and sending them both to the ground.</p>
			<p>"How will we survive?" asked Nuju.</p>
			<p>"We use the mask powers the Great Spirit gave us!" answered Whenua.</p>
			<p>"And just how do we do that?!"</p>
			<p>There was no time for a reply as more columns shot out of the ground. Back on his feet, Nuju pivoted out of the way of a pair of them, not realizing where he was swinging his crystal spike. His Toa tool swept the legs out from under Vakama, sending the Toa of Fire to the ground. The crowd began to laugh.</p>
			<p>Vakama shook off the impact and looked up to see a tidal wave of solid protodermis heading right for the Toa. He jumped to his feet as Nokama pointed to an archway on the far side of the field.</p>
			<p>"Follow me!" she shouted, leading the charge toward safety.</p>
			<p>The huge swell rose behind them, but the Toa were able to maintain their balance and slide down the side of the wave. But now more swells rose up in front of them, each larger than the last. One lifted Whenua high into the air and then dropped him on the field in a heap.</p>
			<p>More swells pounded the Toa from every side. Even as Onewa barely dodged a twenty-five foot tidal wave of protodermis, another hurled Nuju, Vakama, and Nokama in separate directions. Then the largest wave of all rose before them, moving forward at alarming speed and breaking up into large blocks of metal.</p>
			<p>"Time to quick-run!" Matau yelled.</p>
			<p>"Advance!" Nuju yelled.</p>
			<p>"No, retreat!" said Whenua, charging backward and colliding with the Toa of Ice. They both looked up in time to see the blocks of protodermis raining down. Only swift reflexes saved them from being crushed.</p>
			<p>"Enough!" proclaimed Dume. The Matoran in the control box dutifully shut down the field.</p>
			<p>The Toa Metru were scattered all over the field, exhausted. The crowd was silent. Dume peered down at the six figures and smiled.</p>
			<p>"Let us praise these jesters," he said. "Perhaps they thought to entertain us during this difficult time..."</p>
			<p>"No!" shouted Vakama. "We are Toa!"</p>
			<p>"Or are they impostors responsible for Toa Lhikan's demise?" continued Dume. "Vakama here was the last to see him!"</p>
			<p>"Yes, but...no...not true!" Vakama stammered.</p>
			<p>Dume's face leered down from the giant screen. "Seize them!"</p>
			<p>Vakama's eyes widened as he saw Krekka and Nidhiki step up beside Turaga Dume. Could it be...?</p>
			<p>"No, it was them!" he yelled, pointing at the two Dark Hunters. "They did it!"</p>
			<p>Squads of Rorzakh closed in on the Toa, their staffs at the ready. The Matoran in the control box flipped more switches, converting the center of the field into a vast, metallic whirlpool. Closest to the center of the vortex, Whenua, Nuju, and Onewa struggled to resist the pull.</p>
			<p>Nuju tried to dig his crystal spike into the ground, but the force of the whirlpool tore it from his hands and it plunged into the darkness. Seconds later, Nuju joined it, flying headlong toward the vortex. On the way, he smashed into Whenua, sending the Toa of Earth plummeting into the whirlpool as well.</p>
			<p>Matau and Nokama plunged their tools into the protodermis to try and fight the pull. Vakama came flying toward them, but Nokama seized him at the last moment with her free hand.</p>
			<p>Onewa was not so fortunate. With a scream of "Help!" he vanished into the whirlpool.</p>
			<p>Nokama looked around. The Rorzakh were closing in and the three remaining Toa were helpless. Then her eyes fixed on the statue of Toa Lhikan.</p>
			<p>"Vakama!" she shouted, pointing toward the sculpture. "The statue! Bring it down!"</p>
			<p>The Toa of Fire nodded and went to load a disk into his disk launcher. He was half done when he realized he had one of the Great Disks in his hand. Thinking better of it, he substituted disks from his pack.</p>
			<p>Taking as careful aim as he could under the circumstances, Vakama launched a series of disks at the base of the statue. Half of the disks contained the weakness power, half the reconstitute at random power-the combination was explosive, sending the sculpture toppling to the ground. Rorzakh scattered in its wake, some of them drawn into the vortex, others trapped beneath the weight of the statue.</p>
			<p>"Go! Now!" said Nokama.</p>
			<p>The three Toa scrambled over the statue, past the stunned Rorzakh, and out of the Coliseum. As they ran, Matau stole a glance at Vakama's disk launcher. "Impressive Toa tool," he said. "Trade?"</p>
			<p>But Vakama was not listening. His attention, and his anger, were fixed on the Turaga of his city.</p>
			<p>Dume turned to Nidhiki and Krekka, barely controlled anger in his voice. "The new Toa must not interfere with the plan."</p>
			<p>Nidhiki shrugged. "They are mere Matoran in Toa armor. As is our duty, we shall not fail."</p>
			<p>Krekka pondered that for a long moment before nodding his agreement.</p>
			<p>Outside the Coliseum, the three Toa Metru paused to catch their breath. Vakama's mind was still spinning from the revelation that Dume, Nidhiki, and Krekka were allies.</p>
			<p>"The Dark Hunters took Toa Lhikan-for Turaga Dume! He's responsible!" he said.</p>
			<p>Nokama nodded. "And now he'll send them after us."</p>
			<p>"All because the fire-spitter panic-failed," grumbled Matau. He remembered all too well what Vakama had said about standing by while Toa Lhikan was kidnapped.</p>
			<p>Vakama made no reply. There was nothing he could say.</p>
			<p>"We have to get out of here," said Nokama. She looked down to see a transport chute far below. Jumping into one was risky. If the speed and timing of the leap were not just right, she would bounce off the outer layer rather than passing through into the magnetized protodermis flow.</p>
			<p>Taking a deep breath, she jumped off the ledge. An experienced diver, she kept her body as straight as could be and her eyes focused on her destination. She struck the chute perfectly, passing through the outer layer and immediately swimming smoothly in the chute.</p>
			<p>High above, Vakama watched her dive with awe and not a little fear. Ta-Matoran didn't go leaping around like Le-Metru cable climbers or swimming in the sea like Ruki fish. Vakama had never gotten into a chute except through a chute station. Besides being dangerous, it was a sure way to attract the attention of Vahki.</p>
			<p>Behind him, Matau grew impatient. He gave Vakama a shove and sent the Toa of Fire flying. Fortunately, he hit the chute at just the right moment and made it into the protodermis flow safely. It took him a moment to adjust to the new environment. He grabbed a passing piece of cargo and let it pull him along behind Nokama.</p>
			<p>Matau turned at a noise behind him. Krekka and Nidhiki had emerged from the Coliseum. At the sight of the Toa, they shapeshifted into a more aerodynamic mode and shot forward. Panicked, Matau leaped.</p>
			<p>Under ordinary circumstances, the Le-Metru native was one of the best at chute-jumping. But he had never tried to do it with two Dark Hunters right behind him before. His arms and legs were going every which way as he fell. He landed with a hard splat on the top of the chute, then slowly oozed into the protodermis. Part of him was happy for the temporary safety, while part hoped no one he knew had seen him.</p>
			<p>Turaga Dume walked silently through his private chamber. Despite the numerous lightstone lanterns, the vast room still felt shadowy and cold. Ignoring the great throne that rested on the polished floor, Dume triggered a secret door in the rear wall and passed through.</p>
			<p>Beyond the door was a room no eyes other than his own had ever seen. Sunlight poured into the room from either side to strike a pair of huge sundials. The instruments were made of great circular plates inscribed with a language that was ancient when Metru Nui was new, and posts of a dark stone that cast eerie shadows. The plates rotated with a rhythmic clicking, bringing the shadows from the sundial posts closer and closer with each second.</p>
			<p>Turaga Dume walked toward the darkest recesses of the room. A pair of sinister red eyes loomed in the shadows before him. A voice like thunder growled from the pit, "The Mask of Time will not be completed."</p>
			<p>"No," said Turaga Dume. "But when the Great Shadow falls, the Vahki will ensure every Matoran's fate."</p>
			<p>The eyes receded into the darkness. The room was silent as the grave once more.</p>
			<h2>4</h2>
			<p>Toa Nokama twisted her body to avoid slamming into a freight sled. Behind her, Vakama and Matau did the same while trying to maintain their grip on items flying through the chutes. It was the height of the Metru Nui traffic rush and freight convoys were roaring by at alarming speeds.</p>
			<p>Still, her Toa strength and agility made it a task she could handle. The real challenge was figuring out where in Metru Nui to go that the Vahki could not follow.</p>
			<p>Inside the Le-Metru control room that governed the chutes, a very frightened Matoran looked for help-but there was none coming. The Matoran's name was Kongu, and in ages of work he had never run into anything more dangerous than the occasional force sphere or chute breakdown. Now, held in the grip of the Dark Hunter called Krekka, he knew the true meaning of fear.</p>
			<p>"The entire system will explode if I reverse the flow!" he cried.</p>
			<p>In the background, Nidhiki hissed. Krekka raised a powerful arm so that Kongu could get a hint of his fate if he refused to cooperate.</p>
			<p>"Then again, it might work," Kongu said weakly. His hand slammed on a button, and with a great <i>whoosh</i> the magnetized protodermis pumps that powered the chutes began to reverse.</p>
			<p>The Toa's journey came to an abrupt halt. All forward motion stopped in the chutes at once, leaving heroes, Matoran, and freight sleds hanging suspended in the energy field. Vakama and Matau looked at each other and shrugged.</p>
			<p>Then, with an earsplitting roar, the flow of the chutes suddenly reversed itself. The Toa stumbled backward, out of control, smashing into the walls as the transport system picked up speed. There was nothing to grab on to, no way to gain traction. Even thinking was difficult with the constant collisions.</p>
			<p>Nokama somersaulted end over end, catching a glimpse of a freight sled spinning madly and heading in her direction. At the last moment, she and the other Toa flattened themselves against the walls and took only glancing blows from the vehicle.</p>
			<p><i>This can't go on,</i> thought Nokama. <i>It's only a matter of time before something strikes us...or worse, we end up back where we started, in the hands of the Vahki.</i></p>
			<p>With that fate in mind, Nokama dug her twin hydro blades into the bottom of the chute. Holding on to the blades with one hand, she grabbed Vakama with the other. Then Vakama grabbed Matau, linking them all together in a chain.</p>
			<p>His motion stabilized, Matau freed his aero slicer and carved a hole in the bottom of the tube. He looked up to see another out-of-control freight sled bearing down on them. In the instant before it would have struck, the three Toa plunged through the hole and into space.</p>
			<p>Now they hung in mid-air, high above Metru Nui. Nokama clung to her hydro blades, while Vakama held on to her ankle. With his free hand, he clutched Matau.</p>
			<p>"Everyone all right?" asked Nokama.</p>
			<p>Matau looked up from where he dangled above the city. "Oh, sure-fine," he said sarcastically. "Just enjoying the view."</p>
			<p>Nokama looked down at Vakama. The Toa of Fire was staring off into space. "Vakama?" she said.</p>
			<p>But Vakama was no longer there, at least not in his mind. He was lost in another vision...</p>
			<p><i>He was standing next to Toa Lhikan. But as Vakama moved to greet his lost friend, the Toa suddenly transformed into a blinding burst of energy. The sphere of light hovered in the air for a moment before launching skyward.</i></p>
			<p><i>Vakama lifted his gaze to watch it streak across the night sky. As it sped across the blackness, the energy field shifted and changed until it resembled the shooting stars studied by Ko-Metru scholars. But it was no random astronomical event-no, it looked more like an arrow pointing toward...</i></p>
			<p>With a start, Vakama snapped out of his trance. Nokama was looking down at him, concerned.</p>
			<p>"Another foreseeing?" asked the Toa of Water.</p>
			<p>Vakama nodded, a little embarrassed.</p>
			<p>"How about less vision-seeing and more Toa-saving?" shouted Matau.</p>
			<p>Nokama glanced up to see that her hydro blades were losing their grip on the chute. Fighting to stay calm, she began to swing, the movement of her body forcing the other Toa to move as well. Slowly they gained momentum, arcing toward a nearby support tower and then back again. With each swing, the hydro blades lost a bit more of their grip.</p>
			<p>At the apex of the next swing, the Toa toons suddenly came loose. Nokama hurled herself through the air and grabbed onto the support tower. But the jolt rocked Vakama and Matau, causing the Toa of Fire to lose his grip. The Toa of Air plunged toward the ground far below.</p>
			<p>"Matau!" cried Vakama.</p>
			<p>But the Toa of Air could not hear him over the sound of the wind rushing in his ears. Arms and legs outstretched, he was desperately wishing he had mastered his Great Mask of Power. <i>Unless, of course, it was a useless-dumb power like water breathing,</i> he thought. <i>But if it was something like levitation, that would be really welcome-fine right now...</i></p>
			<p>Even as the thought crossed his mind, his fall became a controlled glide. His aero slicers caught the wind, acting like wings. A broad grin broke out on Matau's face.</p>
			<p>"My mask power!" he yelled happily. "I can-"</p>
			<p>The updraft became a downdraft without warning, sending Matau crashing headfirst into a massive screen. "Unnngh! Wind-fly," he groaned.</p>
			<p>As he slid down the screen, Turaga Dume's face glared down from it. "All Matoran should be on the lookout for the false Toa," ordered the elder of Metru Nui.</p>
			<p>Up above, Nokama felt her heart sink. Somehow, she did not think this was what Lhikan had in mind when he gave them the Toa stones.</p>
			<p>Nokama took a swift look around. No, there were no Vahki Keerakh in the area, or even many Matoran, for that matter. This seemed like a safe spot for the three Toa Metru to pause and try to sort out what had just happened.</p>
			<p>Matau spent the time recovering from his first "solo flight". Nokama had made a point of not teasing him about it, since the Toa of Air seemed to feel bad enough already. Vakama was off by himself, doing something with a pair of Great Disks.</p>
			<p>Nokama approached in time to see him move the disks together until they touched. Then something strange happened-the disks softened and began to merge together. Vakama quickly pulled them apart, puzzled and intrigued.</p>
			<p>"Vakama?"</p>
			<p>"Huh?" said the Toa of Fire, not looking up.</p>
			<p>"What was your last vision?" Nokama asked.</p>
			<p>Vakama pointed up at to the sky. A yellow streak of light could be seen against the blackness. "That! Toa Lhikan's spirit star. Each Toa has one. As long as it burns in the night sky, Toa Lhikan remains alive."</p>
			<p>"It is headed toward Po-Metru," said Nokama.</p>
			<p>Matau had joined the group now. He glanced up at the spirit star, shrugged, and said, "What about our captured Toa-brothers?"</p>
			<p>Vakama shook his head. "Only Toa Lhikan can stop Turaga Dume and free the other Toa."</p>
			<p>"And how do you propose we quick-catch a spirit star?" demanded Matau.</p>
			<p>Nokama scanned the area. Down the road, she spotted a Vahki transport vehicle moving slowly through the metru. The long vehicle was propelled by a series of insectlike legs. Its cargo was a collection of large silver spheres. Only a single Vahki was present, serving as driver.</p>
			<p>"Perhaps a way has been revealed, rider," Nokama said, smiling.</p>
			<p>Toa of Water and Toa of Air took off at a run for the transport. When they had gone a few steps, Nokama looked back to see that Vakama hadn't moved. He was still toying with the two Great Disks.</p>
			<p>"Vakama!" she shouted.</p>
			<p>Startled, Vakama returned the disks to his backpack and ran to catch up. As the transport rumbled by, the three of them leaped into the back without being seen. They settled themselves down between tall stacks of silver spheres, the like of which none of them had ever seen before.</p>
			<p>"What are these?" wondered Vakama.</p>
			<p>"Storage containers," replied Matau. "But most odd-looking."</p>
			<p>Vakama brushed his hand against one of the spheres, and his mind exploded...</p>
			<p><i>Without warning, the sphere sprung open, revealing a Matoran in a coma-like slumber. The next moment, the Matoran's heartlight faded to black. Before Vakama could react, the Matoran's mask began to blur and morph, transforming into that of Turaga Dume. A pair of red eyes blazed at Vakama from Dume's Kanohi mask...</i></p>
			<p>The Toa of Fire returned to reality with a start. Another vision...and if it were true...</p>
			<p>He shoved Matau aside to get at the nearest sphere. "Hey! Are you cross-wired?" Matau snapped.</p>
			<p>Vakama threw the sphere open to find...nothing. Nokama joined him to peer into the empty container. "What's wrong, brother?" she asked.</p>
			<p>The Toa of Fire stared hard at the darkness in the heart of the sphere. "Nothing, sister. Nothing at all," he said finally.</p>
			<p>Matau met Nokama's eyes and spun his hand around, a not-so-subtle way of saying Vakama was crazy. Nokama frowned, part of her wishing she could believe that. It would make things much simpler. But deep down she had a feeling that the situation in Metru Nui was far worse than any of them knew...except, perhaps, Vakama.</p>
			<h2>5</h2>
			<p>To Whenua, it didn't seem like things could get any worse. He, Nuju, and Onewa had awakened in a cell, complete with thick rock walls and a solid metal door. Their Toa tools were missing. Worse, not only were they trapped, but they were being tortured by each other's company.</p>
			<p>For the sixth time in the last two minutes, Whenua tried the door. It was still locked tight. "This is just great," he growled. "Before, when I woke up, all I worried about was cataloging. Now I will go down in history as Metru Nui's most wanted."</p>
			<p>Onewa studied the stone walls. His time as a carver had helped him master the art of finding weak points in rock. But this cell did not seem to have any. Whenua's complaints only added to his frustration. "You? I'm the one suffering, locked up with a Ko-Matoran big brain and an Onu-Matoran stock clerk."</p>
			<p>Nuju simply stared at the floor. For one used to the unlimited view from atop a Knowledge Tower, being confined like this was...disturbing. "We will never escape," he said. "Our freedom is gone. Our future is hopeless."</p>
			<p>"Toa, giving up hope?"</p>
			<p>The words came from a darkened corner of the cell. All three Toa Metru started in surprise-they had never imagined someone else was in the cell with them. Now the could see a lone figure sitting in a meditative pose, head down. He wore a robe with an oversized hood that hid his mask. But the experience and wisdom evident in his voice told them this must be a Turaga. But who? And why was he here?</p>
			<p>"Turaga? Forgive me, but I know you not," said Nuju.</p>
			<p>"Your concern should be with your own identity, not mine," the Turaga said quietly. "Freedom and escape are different objectives, but both are easily realized."</p>
			<p>"With all respect, wise one," replied Onewa, "you are stuck in here with us, so-"</p>
			<p>"I have freedom even in here," said the Turaga. "But for escape...Toa mask powers are needed."</p>
			<p>The Toa exchanged glances. Whatever hope they had felt on encountering the mysterious Turaga was fading fast. "I doubt we will ever be in touch with our mask powers," said Nuju.</p>
			<p>"Never doubt what you are capable of," answered the Turaga. "The Great Spirit lives through all of us."</p>
			<p><i>Trapped in a cell with two Toa wannabes and a crazy Turaga,</i> thought Onewa. <i>Next time someone gives me a Toa stone, I think I will just use it as a doorstop.</i></p>
			<p>The Vahki transport crawled through the Sculpture Fields of Po-Metru. Its final destination remained a mystery, but at this point the farther the Toa were from the Coliseum, the more comfortable they felt.</p>
			<p>In the back of the transport, Vakama had succeeded in merging three of the six Great Disks. Using his firestaff, he had begun to shape the combined disks into the rough shape of a mask. Nokama watched him at work for a long time before saying, "Vakama, your destiny no longer lies in sculpting masks. You are a Toa."</p>
			<p>Vakama shrugged. "I don't feel like a Toa."</p>
			<p>"You will. Have faith."</p>
			<p>As the Vahki transport went around a sharp curve, the three Toa Metru leaped out. They were well inside Po-Metru now and there was no point risking discovery by the Vahki at the wheel. They tumbled to safety and stayed low until the transport was out of sight. Then Nokama rose and looked around.</p>
			<p>"An assemblers' village," she said, although it was obvious to all where they were. The village consisted of a broad avenue and a series of buildings. Scattered about were machines, furniture and statues, all of them half-finished. That was normal for such a place, but something else set the Toa on edge.</p>
			<p>The village was abandoned. Doors banged open and closed in the wind. Tools lay where they had been dropped. Vakama's eyes narrowed as he noticed a stack of silver spheres near one of the buildings.</p>
			<p><i>This place feels wrong-bad,</i> thought Matau. "Hello?" he shouted.</p>
			<p>No one answered.</p>
			<p>Puzzled, he turned to Nokama and said, "Guess they all quck-sped."</p>
			<p>"Builders do not abandon their projects without good reason," said the Toa of Water.</p>
			<p>"Then where is everyone?" asked Vakama.</p>
			<p>Krekka burst out of one of the buildings, launching energy bolts at the Toa Metru. "Get ready to find out, Toa!" he bellowed.</p>
			<p>Nokama whirled, spinning her hydro blades fast enough to deflect the bolts. Then all three Toa dove for cover behind one of the buildings. But they had hardly hit the ground before Matau was ready to charge back out again.</p>
			<p>"A Toa-hero knows no fear!" he said as he raced into the street. Krekka's next blast missed him, and the Toa of Air crowed, "You'll have to do better than that!"</p>
			<p>Nidhiki accepted the challenge. Stepping out from behind a building, he hurled an energy web at the Toa. Entangled, Matau hit the ground.</p>
			<p>"Help! There's a Toa down!" he yelled, struggling to get free.</p>
			<p>Hearing his cry, Vakama and Nokama began to circle around the buildings to come to his aid. Meanwhile, Nidhiki and Krekka had both closed in on the captured Toa.</p>
			<p>"Calling all Toa!" Krekka shouted. "Your time is up!"</p>
			<p>A rapidly growing rumble drowned out anything else he said. The ground beneath their feet began to shake violently. "Bioquake?" suggested Vakama.</p>
			<p>Now a cloud of dust had appeared on the far edge of the village, closing in on the Toa and Dark Hunters. From out of that cloud emerged a herd of fearsome beasts. Large bipeds, their powerful hind legs propelled them forward in huge leaps and bounds. Twin tusks on their lower jaws made the herd look like a spiked wall on the march. Their eyes burned red and deep roars came from their mouths as they stormed through the village.</p>
			<p>"Worse!" said Nokama. "Kikanalo!"</p>
			<p>The eyes of the Dark Hunters went wide as they saw the herd bearing down upon them. Kikanalo were known for their stampedes, but were tolerated because their tusks often dug up chunks of protodermis left over from carving projects. Right now, though, their efficiency as recyclers was the last thing on anyone's mind.</p>
			<p>"I hate those things!" said Krekka. His massive form moved amazingly fast as he scrambled to the top of a nearby tower. "I'm outta here."</p>
			<p>"No!" yelled Nidhiki. "Stay low!"</p>
			<p>But Krekka wasn't listening, and Nidhiki had no more time to worry about him. He dove into a construction trench as the herd thundered closer.</p>
			<p>Matau struggled to his feet just as the Kikanalo entered the village. The force of their footfalls sent him flying through the air, to land with a crash near Vakama and Nokama. They darted out and dragged their dazed comrade into a small building.</p>
			<p>Now the Kikanalo had made it as far as Krekka's tower. Almost casually, a few of the beasts rammed the tower with their tusks, sending it toppling over. Nidhiki looked up in time to see his partner and the structure falling right toward him.</p>
			<p>"Next time, listen to me," he muttered.</p>
			<p>Nokama saw Krekka land on top of Nidhiki in the ditch. Using her hydro blades, she cut loose a stack of the silver spheres and sent them rolling toward the ditch. Then she ducked back inside as the spheres crashed into the Dark Hunters.</p>
			<p>Matau and Vakama watched the Kikanalo trampling and smashing assemblers' huts to bits. "We should quick-flee," said the Toa of Air.</p>
			<p>"Nonsense," Nokama replied. "This is the sturdiest structure in the village."</p>
			<p>"Nokama-" Vakama began.</p>
			<p>The Toa of Water cut him off. "We're staying-"</p>
			<p>Suddenly, three Kikanalo crashed through the ceiling of the building. Finding themselves closed in, the beasts panicked and began leaping wildly about, slamming into the Toa again and again. In desperation, Matau grabbed Nokama and Vakama and hurled them out the window before following himself.</p>
			<p>He had acted just in time. Behind him, the building exploded as the angry Kikanalo kicked it to pieces. Once free, they leaped away to join the herd.</p>
			<p>Nokama looked at Matau. "I was wrong. You were right, my brother."</p>
			<p>"It's amazing what you can learn when you're not always speak-teaching," Matau replied.</p>
			<p>The approach of more Kikanalo ended the argument as the Toa fled. They were barely staying ahead of the beasts, whose tusks swiped dangerously close to the three heroes. The lead beast was an aged Kikanalo, his hide covered with strange markings and old scars. He gave an impatient snort as he tried to catch up to the Toa Metru.</p>
			<p>"What did you say?" Nokama asked Matau.</p>
			<p>"I didn't-"</p>
			<p>Matau stopped in midsentence. Nokama's mask had become illuminated, but the Toa of Water did not seem to notice. "Why is the mask glowing?" he asked.</p>
			<p>Then Nokama did the most amazing, shocking thing Matau could ever imagine, under the circumstances: she stopped running. She simply stopped, with a Kikanalo stampede practically on top of her.</p>
			<p>"Nokama?" Vakama shouted.</p>
			<p>But she was paying no attention to him. She turned to face the onrushing beasts as if they were nothing to fear. Vakama and Matau both winced, sure the herd was about to trample their fellow Toa. The lead Kikanalo gave out an angry snort as it closed in on Nokama.</p>
			<p>The Toa of Water responded with a similar sound. The lead Kikanalo, looking stunned, stopped with his tusks mere inches from her mask. The other beasts stopped as well, not in a pileup but like a well-drilled Vahki squad.</p>
			<p>The elder Kikanalo's scars began to glow. He snorted aggressively at the Toa who stood before him. Nokama stared into his eyes as a new world opened up for her.</p>
			<p>Turning back to the Toa, she said excitedly, "Brothers-my mask power! The chief wants to know why we are allied with Dark Hunters."</p>
			<p>Vakama could not believe what he was hearing. Could Nokama really understand what these creatures were saying? Or had his visions finally driven sanity from him? No, this seemed real. Certainly his body ached enough from being thrown out a window onto the street.</p>
			<p>"Tell him we're not," he said to Nokama. "We seek a friend the Hunters have taken."</p>
			<p>Nokama turned her attention back to the Kikanalo chief and gave a series of animalistic grunts and snorts. The elder beast responded in kind, his body language relaxing.</p>
			<p>"You are free to pass," Nokama translated, "since we are both against the Hunters who trespass the beauty of the Herdlands..."</p>
			<p>"Beauty? Where?" Matau asked Vakama. "And who knew Kikanalo could think-talk? I just thought they were dumb beasts."</p>
			<p>The elder Kikanalo grunted. Nokama chuckled as she reported, "Kikanalo still think the same of tall green Matoran."</p>
			<p>"Tall Matoran?" said Matau, shocked. "I am Toa!"</p>
			<p>"Wait," broke in Vakama, with barely contained excitement. "Tall Matoran? Ask him if the Dark Hunters trespassed with a 'tall Matoran'."</p>
			<p>Nokama nodded and translated Vakama's question into the language of the Kikanalo. The Rahi beast responded with a snort.</p>
			<p>"Yes," Nokama said. "They take many things to the 'place of unending whispers'."</p>
			<p>"That must be where they have taken Toa Lhikan!" said Vakama.</p>
			<p>The elder Kikanalo grunted, as if in agreement. "They will show us the way," Nokama translated.</p>
			<p>The three Toa rode across the plains of Po-Metru on Kikanalo. Behind them, the rest of the herd followed close behind. For the first time, Vakama felt some hope. If they could just find Lhikan, rescue him, surely Dume could be stopped. The Toa of Fire had no idea what the Turaga's plans were, or why he had turned against the city, but he had no doubt Lhikan could make things right.</p>
			<p>Matau smiled. This was the sort of adventure he had always dreamed of during the long days riding Ussal crabs through Le-Metru. New places, new excitement, a quest to save a captured hero-this was what being a Toa-hero was all about! Laughing, he stood up on the back of the Kikanalo and started spinning around.</p>
			<p>"Only a great Toa-rider could tame a wild Kikanalo-beast!" he proclaimed.</p>
			<p>The Rahi's response was to stop and buck, tossing the Toa of Air onto the ground. Matau landed with a hard thud.</p>
			<p>"It seems a 'great Toa-rider' has been tamed," said Nokama. She and Vakama both smiled at the sight of Matau sprawled on the plain.</p>
			<p>It would be the last time either one would smile for a long while.</p>
			<h2>6</h2>
			<p>Whenua had lived in dim light, sometimes almost complete darkness, for much of his life. Like any Onu-Matoran, over time his eyes had adjusted to the point where he could see in the semidark. Although much of Onu-Metru was on the surface, Onu-Matoran actually preferred to be in the underground levels of the Archives, because the brightness of the twin suns hurt their sensitive eyes.</p>
			<p>Still, nothing had prepared him for the task at hand-trying to make his way around a small cell with a blindfold on. He kept bumping into walls and other Toa, and his temper was coming to a boil faster than protodermis in a Ta-Metru furnace.</p>
			<p>The mysterious Turaga was not helping matters any. "Do not rely on your memory," he said. "Look beyond your history and see what is."</p>
			<p>Look beyond history? Whenua had been an archivist-he lived for history! Telling an Onu-Matoran to forget about the past was like telling a Ko-Matoran to put away the telescope and lighten up.</p>
			<p>"I'm not a Rahi bat!" snapped Whenua. "I can't see in the dark."</p>
			<p>The Turaga quietly slid a stool in the path of the Toa of Earth. Whenua promptly tripped over it and hit the ground.</p>
			<p>Onewa had been watching the whole exercise from his seat on the stone floor. Now he burst out laughing. "Soon you'll be ready for a game of pin the tail on the ash bear, record-keeper."</p>
			<p>On the other side of the room, Nuju had spent the last hours transferring stones from one large pile to another. It was exhausting work, made all the more so by the fact that he could not see the point of it. How was hauling rocks going to make him a better Toa?</p>
			<p>"I could toil at this task forever and still learn nothing for the future," the Toa of Ice complained.</p>
			<p>The Turaga shook his head. "You could learn that building the most noble tower begins with the placement of a single stone."</p>
			<p>Onewa chuckled. "Build a tower? A thinker would never lay hands on stone. They're too busy with their heads in the stars."</p>
			<p>The Turaga turned to Onewa, smiling. "A Toa's duty is to all Matoran, regardless of metru. So you shall help both your brothers."</p>
			<p>Onewa's smile faded, replaced with a dark scowl. The Turaga extended his hands to the Toa of Stone. In one, he held a rock; in the other a blindfold.</p>
			<p>Dawn was breaking over Po-Metru. As the twin suns shed their light on the canyons, Matau, Nokama, and Vakama lay flat on a ridge, surveying the territory. For Toa used to the crowds and tall buildings of their metrus, this place was unsettling. Barren, largely uninhabited, its most striking feature was the way echoes emanated from the canyon. It made it seem as if a thousand voices were speaking at once, in tones too low to hear.</p>
			<p>The Kikanalo elder grunted. Nokama translated, "The place of unending whispers."</p>
			<p>Down below, twenty Vahki Zadakh from Po-Metru guarded an entrance to Onu-Metru. Powerful and aggressive, they would not shrink from a fight with a thousand Toa, let alone three. Worse, one bolt from their tools and a victim became so suggestible that he or she would accept orders from anyone. Anyone who got stunned by a Zadakh could be made to turn on friends in an instant.</p>
			<p>"Too many to rush," said Nokama.</p>
			<p>"I have a plan. Perhaps we could..." Vakama began.</p>
			<p>Onewa was having an even harder time moving blindfolded than Whenua. Po-Metru carvers relied on their vision and were used to laboring in the bright light of the suns. Darkness was a new world for him, and not one he particularly liked.</p>
			<p>He turned in the wrong direction and slammed right into Whenua. The Toa of Earth ripped off his blindfold and turned on this Turaga.</p>
			<p>"That was a complete waste of time!" Whenua shouted.</p>
			<p>"Without self discovery, you will never find your destiny," the Turaga replied calmly. "It is every Toa's duty to the Great Spirit."</p>
			<p>"This whole thing was a load of 'duty', if you ask me," muttered Whenua.</p>
			<p>Onewa stripped off his blindfold. Strangely, he did not seem angry or upset about having to participate in the exercise. "Sit down, Whenua," he said.</p>
			<p>The Toa of Earth whirled to face him. "Taking orders from a Turaga was one thing, but from an overgrown hammer-swinger?"</p>
			<p>For a moment, the two Toa's eyes were locked on each other. Then Onewa's mask began to glow. Whenua's eyes were glowing now as well, mirroring the look of the Mask of Power. Whenua tried to take a step forward and found that his feet would not move. A second later, he sat down, hard, on the floor, like a puppet whose strings had been cut.</p>
			<p>"That's it," he seethed. "You're history, builder, even if I don't know how you did that!"</p>
			<p>Whenua struggled to rise, arms reaching out to grab hold of Onewa. Nuju frowned at the spectacle of Toa fighting among themselves and snapped, "Stop! Now!"</p>
			<p>Now the Toa of Ice's mask was glowing as well. Suddenly, great stones tore loose from one wall of the prison cell. The rocks flew rapidly across the room to form a wall between Onewa and Whenua. Moreover, they had left a sizable gap in the wall, perfect as an escape route.</p>
			<p>All three Toa stood there, stunned by the turn of events. Then Nuju and Onewa both spoke at once, saying, "Your mask is glowing-your mask power!"</p>
			<p>The Turaga simply gestured to the newly made hole in the wall. "I believe the time has come to leave," he said.</p>
			<p>Vahki were rarely, if ever, surprised by anything. After years of tracking down and subduing Rahi of all sorts, the order enforcement squads were experienced at handling almost any situation. Add to that foiling the ingenious attempts by some Matoran to try and take unscheduled vacations from work-one Ta-Matoran, Takua, practically rated an entire Nuurakh squad to himself-and Vahki could safely be said to have seen it all.</p>
			<p>But even their visual receptors widened at the sight of Nokama emerging from the hills riding a Kikanalo. Vahki were trained to track, apprehend, and pacify. They were not accustomed to their targets coming to them.</p>
			<p>Still, they wasted no time in responding to the Toa Metru's apparent insanity. One squad of Zadakh, stun staffs at the ready, broke off and pursued her. Even as they departed, a second squad spotted Matau on his beast and immediately gave chase. Despite the Zadakh's speed, the Kikanalo's knowledge of the terrain and greater agility allowed him to outdistance the pursuers.</p>
			<p>Then came yet another shock for the Vahki. Instead of continuing to run, Matau and his mount suddenly pivoted, reversed course, and charged. "Aha! Toa never quick-flee!" shouted the Toa of Air.</p>
			<p>The Vahki responded with blasts from their stun staffs, but the fast-moving Kikanalo leaped over and around the energy bolts. Nor did he show any signs of stopping as he plowed into the Vahki squad, his powerful legs slamming into the enforcers and sending them flying.</p>
			<p>Matau smiled broadly as he saw the Vahki falling before his charge. He stood up on the back of the Kikanalo, saying, "Hey, Kikanalo, who's your mas-"</p>
			<p>The Rahi looked up at him and gave a warning snort. Matau decided "master" probably wasn't the best term to use with a beast that could scatter Vahki like proto dust in a windstorm. "I mean who's your partner?" he said, quickly sitting back down.</p>
			<p>Vakama had left his Kikanalo behind and approached the area on foot. He had hoped Nokama and Matau would have distracted all the Vahki from the entrance, but instead he rounded a corner to find three enforcers waiting for him. Their stun staffs blazed away. Vakama loaded and launched disk after disk, blocking each bolt as it came near. Still, he knew he would run out of Kanoka disks long before the Vahki ran out of power.</p>
			<p>Rescue came from above. The elder Kikanalo leaped and landed in between the Toa of Fire and the Vahki. Glaring at the enforcers, he let out a long, low cry. Other Kikanalo emerged from the rocks and joined in the strange sound. It grew louder and louder as more of the Rahi added their voices to the chorus. For a moment, Vakama was convinced he must be going mad-the cry actually seemed to be reaching down into the ground and disturbing the rock.</p>
			<p><i>No, it wasn't madness,</i> he realized. It was really happening. The cry had created a wave in the rocky surface of Po-Metru, which swept quickly toward the Vahki. It struck like a thunderclap, hurtling the enforcers out of sight.</p>
			<p>High on a ridge, Nokama was facing her own problems. She and her Kikanalo had backed up all the way to the edge of a cliff. The Vahki squad was pressing hard. The Toa of Water's hydro blades flashed in the sunlight as she deflected their stun blasts. If the enforcers were frustrated by this, they gave no sign, instead continuing to march forward.</p>
			<p>Nokama didn't need to look back. She knew that one more step by the Kikanalo would send them both plunging to their doom. She hoped the Great Spirit had seen to it that Vakama and Matau had been more successful.</p>
			<p>The Toa of Water braced herself. The Vahki charged.</p>
			<p>A split second later, a squad of Vahki were hanging on for their lives from the edge of the cliff. They had moved forward at full speed to capture a Toa, but when they got there, the Kikanalo jumped high in the air and out of their reach. Unable to stop themselves, the Vahki ran right off the cliff. The Kikanalo returned to earth with a thud.</p>
			<p><i>The Vahki won't fall for that trick twice. They never do. And they won't give up, either,</i> Nokama thought as she rode down from the ridge. <i>I hope the Kikanalo realize the kind of enemies they have made this day.</i></p>
			<p>Krekka and Nidhiki had arrived in time to see Matau's strategy bring down a Vahki squad. Krekka was still furious at the Kikanalo over the incident in the assemblers' village and wanted to bring the Rahi down. Nidhiki had to explain to him, more than once, that their job was to capture Toa, not dumb beasts.</p>
			<p>The insectlike Dark Hunter pointed down to where Matau stood alone on the rocky plain. "Circle right," he ordered. Krekka nodded and moved off as Nidhiki headed to the left.</p>
			<p>With some difficulty, Krekka made his way down into the box canyon. He didn't understand why it was necessary to sneak up on the little green Toa-better to just charge in and tackle him. <i>Yeah,</i> he said to himself. <i>That's the thing to do. I'll drag him back to Nidhiki by his mask.</i></p>
			<p>Matau had wandered behind some rocks. Krekka smiled and charged, already imagining how the Toa would beg for mercy. But when he reached the boulders, it wasn't Matau who was waiting there, but Krekka's partner.</p>
			<p>"Nidhiki?" Krekka asked, mystified. "Where'd the Toa go?"</p>
			<p>"You must've let him slip past," snapped the other Dark Hunter. "Circle the other way back."</p>
			<p>Krekka turned and left. He couldn't for the life of him figure out how Matau could have gone behind those rocks and then disappeared. He would have been even more puzzled if he had looked over his shoulder and seen a second Nidhiki approaching in the distance.</p>
			<p>When that Nidhiki reached the rocks, it was to see what appeared to be Krekka standing around doing nothing. "Where is the Toa?" Nidhiki demanded.</p>
			<p>Krekka shrugged.</p>
			<p>"You let him get by you?"</p>
			<p>"Maybe he got by <i>you</i>," rumbled Krekka.</p>
			<p>Nidhiki turned away, muttering something about Dark Hunters who weren't bright enough to come in out of a rockslide. Once he was gone, the "Krekka" he had been speaking to morphed into Matau, his mask glowing with Toa power.</p>
			<p>"Shapeshifting!" said the Toa of Air. "Some mask powers are worth waiting for!"</p>
			<p>Matau mounted his Kikanalo and rode out of the canyon.</p>
			<p>Krekka and Nidhiki spotted each other across the canyon. Both began shouting at once.</p>
			<p>"Where's the Toa?"</p>
			<p>"How should I know?"</p>
			<p>"You told me to go the other way!"</p>
			<p>"I told you to go that way!"</p>
			<p>The canyon turned their voices into more of the "unending whispers" for which it was famous, the echoes of their argument carrying a long way.</p>
			<p>	*	*	*</p>
			<p>The sounds reached the audio receptors of the last remaining Zadakh, but they were too busy to pay any attention. Snarling Kikanalo surrounded the squad, moving inexorably forward and kicking up a huge cloud of dust in the process. For a long moment, nothing was visible through the dust and the air was filled with Kikanalo snorts. When the cloud finally cleared away, the Vahki lay heaped in a pile.</p>
			<p>Nokama and Vakama rode past them. Vakama was still tinkering with the Mask of Power he had created from the Great Disks. They were joined a moment later by Matau.</p>
			<p>The elder Kikanalo grunted at Nokama. The Toa of Water dismounted and turned to her fellow Toa. "The chief said not bad...for flat-walkers. They will cover our herd tracks." Then she expressed her thanks to the elder in the language of the Kikanalo.</p>
			<p>"Toa Lhikan will forever be in your debt," Vakama said to the elder beast.</p>
			<p>Matau had dismounted as well and moved to say good-bye to his Kikanalo. The Rahi acted first, giving the Toa a big, sloppy lick on his mask. "Arrgh!" Matau yelled, backing away.</p>
			<p>With the Vahki defeated or driven off, it was now safe to enter the cave. Vakama put his project away and joined the other two as they entered the darkness of the cave. Behind them, the Kikanalo herd used their powerful legs to start a rockslide that sealed the cavern shut. Satisfied that they had blocked any pursuit of the Toa, the herd moved off.</p>
			<p>None of the beasts chanced to look up in the sky. If they had, they would have seen the form of a lone Rahi hawk circling above the canyon. After a few more moments, Nivawk wheeled and soared toward the center of the city, carrying precious information for Turaga Dume.</p>
			<h2>7</h2>
			<p>Onewa, Whenua, Nuju and their Turaga friend peered cautiously out of the opening in their cell wall. They had expected to see the barren plains of Po-Metru, but instead it seemed they were a long way from the outdoors. Their cell was inside a huge underground cavern, resting on an island of its own in the middle of a sea of sand. Stranger still, the cavern was empty-no patrols, no slobbering Rahi ready to hunt down escapees, no one.</p>
			<p>"Why aren't there Vahki guards?" asked Onewa. The silence unnerved him. Somehow, the Toa of Stone felt they were in worse danger now than when they had been locked up.</p>
			<p>The Turaga did not make him feel any better. "Perhaps none are needed," the wise one said, a hint of warning in his voice.</p>
			<p>Still, an escape was not an escape if one never leaves the cell. The four allies slipped through the gap and began trudging across the sand dunes. It was tough going for the Toa Metru, for their added weight caused their feet to sink deep in the sand.</p>
			<p>They had been journeying only a short time when they saw the sand up ahead begin to move. What began as a subtle shifting of sand grains rapidly evolved into a huge dune coming right for them, accompanied by a monstrous groan.</p>
			<p>"Now I know why!" said Nuju, as he and the others fled. But there was no way to run far enough or fast enough to outrace what was chasing them.</p>
			<p>Behind the Toa, a massive form broke through the sand. The huge, horned, wormlike beast was known as a troller, and it was one of the most feared creatures in Po-Metru. It lived far beneath the sands, emerging only now and then to feed. No Po-Matoran had ever stayed in the vicinity of a troller long enough to find out just what it ate. But its gaping mouth was large enough to swallow an entire block in a metru.</p>
			<p>Onewa felt the hot, fetid breath of the troller on his back. He turned to see its jaws about to close on him. Unbidden, his Mask of Power glowed once more.</p>
			<p>High above the Coliseum, Nivawk circled once, twice, three times before swooping down. The Rahi hawk alighted on his perch in the sundial chamber.</p>
			<p>"What news, Nivawk?" asked Turaga Dume.</p>
			<p>The great bird screeched and squawked, speaking in a language Dume had mastered ages ago. He reported that Vakama, Matau, and Nokama had defeated the Vahki guards and were even now making their way into the prison cave.</p>
			<p>Turaga Dume moved to the darkest corner of the room. A pair of red eyes stared at him from the shadows. "This mask has been useful," said Dume. "Now for its final task."</p>
			<p>Dume took a step forward into the darkness. Nothing blocked his way, for there was no one else in the chamber. Only a shadowed mirror from which Dume's true face reflected back at him. Dume reached up and peeled off his Kanohi Mask of Power, to reveal another underneath-a twisted, blackened Mask of Shadows.</p>
			<p>The guise of Metru Nui's Turaga had been cast aside, simply another mask to be removed. In his place stood an entity of darkness and destruction, and now the ultimate power in the city of legends.</p>
			<p>"No one must alter our destiny," rumbled the dark figure.</p>
			<p>The face of Turaga Dume appeared on kinetic displays all over the city. Matoran paused in their work to pay attention to what their elder had to say.</p>
			<p>"Matoran of Metru Nui," the Turaga began. "You are required to gather at the Coliseum."</p>
			<p>The troller slowly made its way to the rocky "coast" of the sea of sand. It swerved neither left nor right, even when small Rahi ran across its path. With a mighty heave, the beast beached itself and then opened its mouth as if in a yawn.</p>
			<p>Three Toa and a Turaga emerged from the maw of the monster, gasping for air. Whenua turned to Onewa, saying, "Good job, brother. But next time, mind control something with better breath."</p>
			<p>A tunnel led from the sand pit to a destination none of them could guess. But if they wanted to escape before any Vahki patrols came to investigate, they had no other choice. They would have to take their chances in the darkness.</p>
			<p><i>At least, we don't have to go in there without our tools,</i> thought Onewa. All of their equipment was stacked neatly by the tunnel entrance, including a compact item that the Turaga took for himself. Onewa found that it felt good to have his proto pitons in his hands once more. He vowed that no one would ever take these symbols of his Toa power away again.</p>
			<p>Nuju turned from the tunnel entrance. "All that lies ahead is shadow."</p>
			<p>"It has to be better than what's behind us," said Whenua.</p>
			<p>The Toa of Earth took a step into the dark tunnel. Then he stopped in surprise-the tunnel was suddenly bright as day! How was this possible? He didn't see any lightstones anywhere, and he was certain none of the other Toa had one.</p>
			<p>He turned back to check. The other Toa winced as if from glare. That was when Whenua realized they were brightly lit too. It was his mask! His mask was glowing and lighting the way in front of him!</p>
			<p>"Your mask power," said Onewa.</p>
			<p>"Come on," replied Whenua, smiling. "Our future just got a whole lot brighter."</p>
			<p>Together, the three Toa and the Turaga entered the tunnel. The darkness vanished before them, something they hoped was an omen for the days to come.</p>
			<p>They had been walking for some time through a strange tunnel lined with doors on either side. A faint sound came from around a sharp corner, something like metal scraping against stone. Whenua turned to his companinons and signaled for them to stay put while he investigated.</p>
			<p>The Toa of Earth rounded the corner and ran right into a Vahki coming the other way. The glow from Whenua's mask blinded the guard, giving the Toa an opening, and the two grappled. Whenua expected to be able to overcome a Vahki with his Toa power, but this one seemed unusually strong.</p>
			<p>Then the Vahki did something totally unprecedented and unexpected-it talked. "Hey! Turn out the bright-light!"</p>
			<p>Stunned, Whenua released his hold. Vahki couldn't talk...and that voice was familiar. "Matau?!"</p>
			<p>The Vahki enforcer smiled-another thing no Vahki had ever done-and morphed into the form of the Toa of Air. "<i>Toa</i> Matau to you, my brother," he said.</p>
			<p>Reunited, the Toa exchanged greetings and brief accounts of their adventures that brought them to the tunnels. Only Vakama stood off to the side, reluctant to join in the celebration.</p>
			<p>"Shapeshifting?" Whenua asked Matau.</p>
			<p>"Yeah," said the Toa of Air. "And you should hear Nokama translating Kikanalo."</p>
			<p>"So we've all discovered our mask powers." No one noticed Vakama hang his head at Whenua's statement.</p>
			<p>Nuju turned to Nokama. "How did you know we would be here?"</p>
			<p>"We didn't. We came for Toa Lhikan."</p>
			<p>Onewa shook his head. "Toa Lhikan is not here."</p>
			<p>The Turaga took a step forward, saying, "Not exactly."</p>
			<p>All eyes turned to his small form as he removed his cloak. For the first time, the others saw that he wore the same mask as Lhikan. In that moment, they knew-despite his reduced stature and power, this <i>was</i>-</p>
			<p>"Toa Lhikan?!" Vakama said, shocked.</p>
			<p>The Turaga smiled. "No, you are Toa. I am Turaga Lhikan."</p>
			<p>"Why didn't you tell us who you were?" asked Whenua.</p>
			<p>"Your task was to discover who <i>you</i> are," replied Turaga Lhikan. "Only with such knowledge would your powers reveal themselves."</p>
			<p>"Fast-stop!" said Matau. "Where did-?"</p>
			<p>"My power go?" Lhikan finished for him. "It lives on, in all of you."</p>
			<p>Vakama turned away, but Lhikan spoke directly to the Toa of Fire. "Tell me, the heart of Metru Nui, you have it safe?"</p>
			<p>"Well...we're rescuing you now," Vakama answered, sounding a little confused by the question.</p>
			<p>Lhikan sighed. "You are misguided, Toa Vakama. I am not Metru Nui's heart. The Matoran are. We must save them before it's too late."</p>
			<p>Nokama turned to the Toa of Fire. "Vakama?"</p>
			<p>"I have failed you again," Vakama said to Lhikan. Seeing the concern in Nokama's face, he snapped, "I told you I am a cross-wired freak, chasing his dreams, wasting everyone's time! I'm not a Toa! I'm not even a good mask-maker."</p>
			<p>Further discussion was cut off by the sound of marching feet in the tunnels. It didn't take the wisdom of a Turaga to figure out what they belonged to.</p>
			<p>"Vahki!" said Matau. "Run now, talk later!"</p>
			<p>The group took off down a side corridor, Vakama bringing up the rear. They passed a number of huge doors, of the sort normally seen in the Archives. No one could imagine what purpose they would serve in Po-Metru.</p>
			<p>Nokama paused to wait for Vakama to catch up. Lhikan shook his head and gestured for her to continue with the others.</p>
			<p>"We cannot help Vakama," he said. "He needs to see the dignity in his own reflection. Only then will his destiny reveal itself."</p>
			<p>Behind them, Vakama stopped short. His eyes had spotted something the other Toa had missed, something disturbingly familiar. It was a silver sphere, just like the ones he had seen in the Vahki transport.</p>
			<p>Vakama wiped away the dust and opened the sphere. The hatch rose with a hydraulic hiss, to reveal...</p>
			<p>"Turaga Dume?" Vakama said, shaken to the core of his being. But there was no escaping it-there was the Turaga, minus his mask, sleeping inside the vessel. In his heart, Vakama knew this was no ordinary sleep and Dume would not be roused with a shake.</p>
			<p>Lhikan looked over his shoulder at Vakama. "The true Turaga Dume. As I feared, an impostor is posing as a mask we all trust."</p>
			<p>The world spun around Vakama. He knew the Turaga had been behaving oddly, but he never suspected...Another vision assailed his senses. Hundreds of silver spheres...sinister red eyes...whispered words that spoke of evils yet to come.</p>
			<p>The other Toa had turned back at the news. "If this is Turaga Dume..." said Onewa.</p>
			<p>"You don't want to know who is in control of Metru Nui," Vakama replied.</p>
			<p>The sounds of Vahki on the march came from another corridor. The Toa Metru were about to be trapped between two order enforcement squads. Whenua looked around desperately, finally spotting their only avenue of escape.</p>
			<p>"In here!" he yelled, pulling open one of the massive doors. The Toa and Turaga Lhikan rushed inside a split second before the Vahki reached the spot. Whenua slammed the door behind them. Frustrated, the Vahki pounded on it. The door rapidly began to give way before their might.</p>
			<p>The Toa examined their surroundings. They were in a Po-Metru storage facility littered with tools, half-finished carvings, and one potential ticket to freedom. Matau was the first to spot it.</p>
			<p>"A Vahki transport!" he shouted.</p>
			<p>Although based on the same design as the one in which he, Nokama, and Vakama had hitched a ride before, this transport was even larger. Its insectoid legs looked as if they had not moved in an age, and certainly the thick coating of dust made it seem long unused. But Matau knew these vehicles well. Like the Vahki they carried, they never wore out.</p>
			<p>He took a step toward the transport, but stopped dead at a hissing sound. It came from the darkest corner of the room. The Toa Metru were not alone, and they had the worst possible company.</p>
			<p>"Lohrak!" shouted Turaga Lhikan, as the hideous, winged serpents flew from the shadows. Their huge, powerful mouths were filled with row upon row of needlelike teeth, which gleamed in the light.</p>
			<p>Lohrak were known, and feared, throughout Metru Nui. First discovered by Onu-Metru miners years ago, the creatures had spread all over the city. They were as territorial and aggressive as they were slimy and disgusting. Dwellers in darkness, they had proved to be a particular problem for archivists and maintenance workers. But every metru had Matoran who could share a frightening story of a Lohrak encounter.</p>
			<p>Workers who wandered off the job to go exploring were warned that Lohrak might lurk anywhere. For a time, the creatures were even pronounced a protected species by Turaga Dume, in hopes of stopping digging projects that might unearth more of the monsters.</p>
			<p>At the moment, though, it was the Toa who needed protection. The first Lohrak lunged at Whenua, who dove out of the way. Others had wrapped themselves around Turaga Lhikan and Toa Nokama's hydro blades. Nuju struggled with his crystal spikes to pry two more of the beasts off his legs.</p>
			<p>It was chaos. The Lohrak swooped and dove as the Toa desperately tried to dodge and regroup. Meanwhile, the Vahki continued trying to break down the door. Vakama, Matau, and Nuju finally managed to join together to form a united defense, but then all three were blinded by the radiance of Whenua's mask.</p>
			<p>"Onewa, mind-control these things!" shouted the Toa of Earth.</p>
			<p>Onewa concentrated, his mask beginning to glow. But the power of the Kanohi did not slow down the Lohrak's attack. "There are too many!" he said.</p>
			<p>"Then do something else," said Whenua. "Some Toa we turned out to be."</p>
			<p>"Someone must take charge," said Lhikan.</p>
			<p>The words cut through the doubts that Vakama carried with him. Lhikan was right. If one of them did not take command, their struggle was going to end here in this dusty storage room. There would be no one to warn the Matoran, to stop Dume, or to bring Nidhiki and Krekka to justice.</p>
			<p><i>I have been all wrong,</i> he said to himself. <i>A Toa is not someone who has no fear-but someone who masters their fear. Toa can doubt, and worry, and question, just like a Matoran. But in the end, a Toa must act.</i></p>
			<p>"You found your mask powers!" he shouted to the other Toa. "Now remember your elemental powers!"</p>
			<p>It was a desperate gamble and he knew it. The Toa had used up most of their elemental powers in the quest to find the Great Disks. None of them knew for sure how long it would take the powers to recharge. What if they had not come back yet?</p>
			<p><i>Only one way to know-learn,</i> thought Matau. Shouting "Wind," he raised his aero slicers, unleashing a blast of wind just strong enough to blow the Lohrak off himself, Nokama, Lhikan, Vakama, and Whenua.</p>
			<p>Nokama followed his lead. Using her hydro blades, she hurled a blast of water at Nuju and Onewa, scattering the Lohrak that besieged them. "Water!" she cried triumphantly.</p>
			<p>"We need to trap them," said Vakama.</p>
			<p>Whenua and Onewa went to work. Using his earthshock drills, Whenua channeled his elemental power into the wall. His seismic forces cracked the stone, creating a gap almost big enough to hold the Lohrak. Onewa used his proto pitons to enlarge the opening and smooth the stone.</p>
			<p>Vakama's elemental powers had not yet returned in force, but his mask-making tool was able to create enough heat and flame to drive the creatures into the gap. Once they were inside, Nuju sealed it shut with a layer of transparent ice. Behind the ice, the trapped Lohrak snapped their jaws angrily.</p>
			<p>"We have our unity," said Vakama. "Now let's do our duty."</p>
			<p>Behind him, the door began to crack under the relentless pounding of the Vahki. They would be through in a matter of seconds, and all hope of escape would be lost. More likely, the Toa Metru would wind up docile servants of order, happily laboring under the watchful eye of the Turaga Dume impostor.</p>
			<p>The Toa climbed into the Vahki transport. As Matau had expected, getting it started was not difficult. But there was one other problem...</p>
			<p>"Our only exit is blocked," said Whenua. He was right-the Toa had angry Vahki behind them, and a solid wall in front.</p>
			<p>"Then we'll make our own," Vakama replied, new confidence in his voice. "Come on, destiny awaits."</p>
			<p>"What about Turaga Dume?" asked Onewa.</p>
			<p>"He'll be safe until we return," said Vakama. "Now go!"</p>
			<p>The Vahki transport shot forward. Whenua stood on the hood, his earthshock drills revved up. The vehicle accelerated rapidly and the Toa watched as the solid stone wall came closer and closer. Whenua leaned forward a little, bracing for the moment his drills would strike stone.</p>
			<p>Impact! The Toa of Earth's tools bore through the rock with ease, digging an exit tunnel for the transport. Just as they exited the chamber, the door gave way and the Vahki poured in. They looked around, annoyed. Where had their quarry gone? Their orders were very specific: apprehend and pacify. But these Toa were proving hard to catch.</p>
			<p>At the controls, Matau eased the vehicle upward as Whenua continued to dig. Soon they were riding up a gentle ramp, headed for the surface and freedom.</p>
			<p>Matau turned to Nokama, smiling. "I see us taking a romantic ride-drive."</p>
			<p>"And you believe Vakama has odd visions?" Nokama shot back.</p>
			<h2>8</h2>
			<p>The Vahki transport exploded out of the ground. Matau had been worried about the possibility of injuring Matoran when the vehicle hit the surface. Now he saw he need not have worried, because there were no Matoran in sight.</p>
			<p>Anywhere.</p>
			<p>For the first time, the Toa of Air wondered if they were going to be too late. They would go down in legend as the heroes who took too long to come to the rescue. Then again, if they weren't on time, there might not be anyone left to write the legends. He leaned on the throttle and rocketed the transport to the heart of the city.</p>
			<p>Up front, Whenua collapsed, exhausted. He had never felt such complete and utter fatigue in his whole life, but it was a good feeling. It meant he had done his job and come through when the Toa needed him most. Maybe he <i>could</i> do this job, after all.</p>
			<p>Onewa leaned forward. "Hey, glow-head."</p>
			<p>Whenua turned to look at him, bracing for another one of Onewa's insults. But instead the Toa of Stone held out a hand and said, "Well done, my brother."</p>
			<p>Both Toa smiled and clanked their fists together.</p>
			<p>Further back, Vakama was absorbed in mask-making once again. He couldn't explain why, but he had a strong feeling this mask he was making was going to be vital to saving the city.</p>
			<p><i>If it can be saved,</i> he thought. <i>Whoever is posing as Dume has Nidhiki, Krekka, and the Vahki on his side. Plus the Matoran believe him to be the city's elder and will follow his orders. I only hope they are not the last orders they ever follow.</i></p>
			<p>Matoran streamed into the Coliseum from all over the city, under the watchful optical receptors of the Vahki. Most looked confused, some looked worried, but a few were simply happy for a break from work. All of them had come in response to Turaga Dume's call. They had no idea what had prompted the city-wide alert, but they were sure it was nothing that Dume could not handle. After all, he was the Turaga, wasn't he?</p>
			<p>The false Turaga Dume watched the unsuspecting Matoran file in. They were so innocent. They would never be able to handle the changes that were coming. Better that they should be sheltered from it all, until such time as he decided they could resume their lives again.</p>
			<p>He turned to look at the massive sundial. The shadows of the twin suns had begun to partially overlap. Smiling, he glanced at a Kanohi Mask of Power that hung on the wall, the symbol of the Great Spirit Mata Nui.</p>
			<p>"Ah, twilight," he whispered. "The dawn of shadows."</p>
			<p>The Vahki transport sped through the streets of Metru Nui. None of the Toa Metru said a word as they traveled. They were all taking in the spectacle of a completely empty city. The streets, workplaces, and chutes were all deserted, almost as if no one had ever lived there. It was awe-inspiring and more than a little frightening.</p>
			<p>On screens all over the city, the image of Turaga Dume hung like a shadow. He repeated the same words, over and over: "Matoran of Metru Nui are required to gather at the Great Coliseum for an important announcement."</p>
			<p>Vakama turned to Turaga Lhikan. "Turaga, you said I must 'stop the darkness'. But sunsfall isn't for-"</p>
			<p>"Just because the suns hang above us now does not mean that they will always burn bright," Lhikan replied.</p>
			<p>Nuju and Whenua looked skywards to see the two suns arc toward each other. "Of course," said the Toa of Earth. "The legend of eternal shadow."</p>
			<p>"When the light of the Great Spirit will be lost," said Nuju.</p>
			<p>Nokama understood now, and it was worse than she could ever have imagined. "We don't have much time!" she cried, not realizing that time had already run out.</p>
			<p>Matoran sat expectantly in their seats, engaging in nervous conversation with each other. Then the huge Coliseum screen flared to life and the mask of Turaga Dume looked down upon them.</p>
			<p>"Matoran, rejoice, for today will be a momentous climax to your history," he said, in a benevolent tone.</p>
			<p>The Matoran looked at each other, puzzled. Their confusion grew as Vahki transports pulled into the arena, carrying scores of shiny silver capsules.</p>
			<p>Matau steered the transport sharply around a corner and poured on the speed. The Coliseum was just up ahead, its entrance guarded by Vahki enforcers. "Grip-tight!" shouted the Toa of Air.</p>
			<p>The Vahki realized too late that the vehicle was not going to stop. Startled, they dove aside as the transport smashed through the Coliseum gates. Debris flew everywhere. Matau forgot to maintain control as the vehicle skidded across the arena floor.</p>
			<p><i>Come on,</i> he said to himself. <i>You are a Toa-hero! You are a Le-Metru star! You can stop one quick-fast Vahki cart!</i></p>
			<p>He yanked back on the controls and the rear of the vehicle whipped to the right before finally sliding to a stop. But if Matau expected applause from the audience of Matoran, he was sadly mistaken. There were no Matoran in the Coliseum...none that were conscious, anyway. Shocked, the Toa Metru saw the Vahki closing the last of the capsules, which now contained the population of Metru Nui.</p>
			<p>The Toa of Air shook his head. This could not be right. There were nowhere near enough capsules here to hold all of the Matoran. Where were the rest of them?</p>
			<p>A voice came from the giant screen, but it was not the voice of Turaga Dume. It was a dark sound that sent chills through the Toa. It was the sound of shadow and fear, decay and rot, a corruption beyond anything the Toa could imagine. It was the growls of wild Rahi in the night, the hiss of angry Rahkshi, and the thunder that shook the ground, all entwined together in one terrible noise.</p>
			<p>"Too late, Toa," the false Turaga said. "The shadow has arrived."</p>
			<p>The Toa Metru looked up at the screen. "Turaga Dume" slowly reached up and removed his mask, revealing a pair of blazing red eyes and a face all too well-known to the heroes. Even in the shape of a Turaga, there was no denying the raw power that radiated from the figure. Once he had been a being trusted and respected by all, but now...now he was a stranger from the shadows.</p>
			<p>Turaga Lhikan was the first to find his voice. "Makuta," he said, stunned. "You were sworn to protect the Matoran!"</p>
			<p>"I shall," said Makuta. "And when they awake, <i>I</i> will be their Great Spirit."</p>
			<p>Vakama could not believe what he was hearing. He knew there was a plot against the Matoran, he knew that "Dume" was an impostor, but he had never dreamed of something so monstrous. How could Makuta-how could anyone-be so twisted and evil that he would try to take the place of the Great Spirit, Mata Nui?</p>
			<p>"Deceit and self-interest will never be virtues the Matoran honor," the Toa of Fire spat.</p>
			<p>A rumble began to grow, slowly at first, then faster, so loud it was deafening. Yet Makuta's voice could be clearly heard throughout the din, heavy with triumph. "How very bold. Now embrace the nightfall. Even the Great Spirit will soon sleep."</p>
			<p>The Toa and Turaga lifted fearful eyes to the sky. A darkness passed over them, cutting off the light. Shadow reached down like a great hand to seize Metru Nui, engulfing the city in an all-consuming blackness. Mdday had become midnight.</p>
			<p>Forked lightning bolts stabbed down from the Coliseum's energy pylons. The ground shook violently as a spiderweb of cracks appeared in the walls. A great fissure appeared in the floor of the arena, racing toward the heroes.</p>
			<p>The legend of eternal shadow had come true. The end of all was near.</p>
			<p>Only the Vahki, heartless machines that they were, seemed unfazed by the disaster unfolding around them. Optical receptors aglow in the darkness, they marched toward the Toa's vehicle. Makuta obviously intended that there would be no loose ends left behind.</p>
			<p>But worrying about their own safety was the last thing on the minds of the Toa. "We must find the Matoran!" yelled Vakama. "Whenua!"</p>
			<p>Whenua nodded and concentrated as never before. His Mask of Power glowed as brightly as a sun, its light piercing the ground. Suddenly he was able to see through solid matter, his vision extending down into a storage hold far beneath the Coliseum. Vahki enforcers were busy stacking silver cylinders on huge metal racks that stretched from floor to ceiling.</p>
			<p>"Below the Coliseum!" said Whenua.</p>
			<p>The Toa of Air slammed on the controls, throwing the transport into high gear. Vahki went flying as the Toa headed for an underground access tunnel. One Vahki managed to recover in time to leap and dig its tools into the rear of the transport, slowly starting to climb toward where the Toa sat.</p>
			<p>Nokama turned and spotted the unwelcome guest. With a quick swipe of her hydro blades, she sliced off that section of the transport, sending the Vahki tumbling away.</p>
			<p>Makuta triggered the controls that caused Dume's box to ascend. The energy pylons bent to his will, sending their lightning discharges into his body. He hungrily absorbed the raw energy into himself until it became too much for the frail form of a Turaga to bear.</p>
			<p>The moment he had waited for-the moment of transformation-had arrived.</p>
			<p>The transport roared through the tunnel. Three Vahki leaped from above as it passed, landing on the roof of the vehicle. They immediately began pounding with their tools to gain access.</p>
			<p>Inside the cockpit, Matau flipped a lever. The transport's legs extended, lifting the vehicle up high. A second later, a "low bridge" stripped the Vahki off the top and sent them tumbling to the ground.</p>
			<p>The transport slid to a stop in the middle of the storage facility. The Toa disembarked to view a horrifying sight. All around them were the silver spheres, stacked as high as the eye could see. Each one contained a Matoran who not so long ago had been laughing, working, playing.</p>
			<p>Nokama peered inside one of the spheres. The Matoran within slept an unnatural sleep, eyes dark, heartlight faintly pulsating. He was still alive, at least, but trapped in a slumber which, for all the Toa knew, was endless.</p>
			<p>"Can we save them all?" she asked.</p>
			<p>"Time is too short," replied Vakama. "But if we save a few, we save hope for all."</p>
			<p>The Toa hurriedly loaded six spheres into the transport, all the while watching for Vahki. They could not know what was happening up above, but in their hearts they knew Makuta would not let them escape without a fight.</p>
			<p>"Let's get them to safety," said Vakama.</p>
			<p>High above the Coliseum, Makuta now reigned supreme. His frail Turaga form had been replaced by a swirling vortex of dark energy. The energy pylons continued to pour bolts of lightning into his new shape, feeding him the power he craved. Makuta's red eyes gleamed in the center of the shadow.</p>
			<p>Nivawk circled the vortex, careful not to come too close. His caution was wasted, as a black tendril of pure energy reached out and dragged him into the swirling mass of darkness.</p>
			<p>Hidden by the shadows, the Vahki transport accelerated away from the Coliseum. Matau struggled to keep the vehicle on the road as earth tremors rocked the city. Towers crumbled and chutes buckled and fell as they raced toward Ga-Metru.</p>
			<p>Suddenly Krekka and Nidhiki were flanking the vehicle in their flight mode. Before any of the Toa could react, they had morphed back into their normal shapes and leaped into the vehicle. Krekka grabbed Matau, fighting him for control of the transport.</p>
			<p>"Time for a new driver!" shouted the Dark Hunter.</p>
			<p>Nidhiki ignored the Toa and made straight for Lhikan, his eyes filled with hate. "Toa or Turaga, Lhikan, your fate shall be the same."</p>
			<p>Nidhiki launched an energy web at the Turaga, only to watch, astounded, as it slowed and then stopped in midair. Nearby, Nuju's mask glowed as he used his telekinetic power to halt the net.</p>
			<p>Now it was Onewa's turn. He focused his power of mind control on Krekka, taking over the body of the Dark Hunter. Under Onewa's direction, Krekka whirled and grabbed hold of Nidhiki.</p>
			<p>"Get off!" shouted Nidhiki.</p>
			<p>"My thoughts exactly," Onewa muttered. With a mental shove, Krekka jumped off the speeding vehicle, taking his partner with him.</p>
			<p>Lhikan smiled and clanked his fist with Onewa.</p>
			<p>Nidhiki and Krekka shook their heads, trying to recover from the impact of hitting the road. Krekka had no idea how they had wound up there. The last thing he remembered, he was fighting the green Toa and winning.</p>
			<p>Neither one noticed the coils of dark energy approaching. Then the shadow was around them both, dragging them back into the Coliseum to an unknown fate.</p>
			<h2>9</h2>
			<p>Matau steered the transport across the bridge leading to Ga-Metru. He tried his best to stay focused on the task at hand, and not pay attention to the damage being done to his beloved city.</p>
			<p>"I always believed all this would stand forever," Nokama said sadly.</p>
			<p>"Sometimes you shouldn't look back," answered Whenua. "Only ahead."</p>
			<p>"Ahead does not appear so great either," said Nuju.</p>
			<p>The Toa looked ahead to see hundreds of Vahki standing in the middle of the bridge. Twenty abreast, they blocked the way from rail to rail.</p>
			<p>"Where to now?" said Matau.</p>
			<p>Vakama had gone back to tinkering with the Mask of Power he was crafting. "Our future lies beyond Metru Nui," he said confidently.</p>
			<p>Matau nodded. He wasn't sure what that meant, but he knew there was only one safe way to get off this bridge. "I sure hope you're guided by the Great Spirit," he growled, "because this is definitely cross-wired!"</p>
			<p>The Toa of Air threw the transport into a hard ninety degree turn and sped toward the rail. The Toa hung on to whatever they could, hardly able to believe what was about to happen. With a final burst of speed, the transport smashed through the rail and plunged into the storm-tossed waters far below.</p>
			<p>The Vahki gathered at the newly made gap in the rail and looked down. There were no signs of Toa or any wreckage of their vehicle. All that could be seen were the waves beating against the bridge supports as if they hoped to bring the structure crashing down.</p>
			<p>Then a few bubbles popped to the surface, followed by the transport itself, still intact. The six spheres, strapped to the vehicle, had made it buoyant enough to rise. "We saved them," sadi Nokama, pointing at the containers that held the sleeping Matoran. "Now they saved us."</p>
			<p>Nidhiki and Krekka had no idea what was happening. They had served Turaga Dume faithfully, hadn't they? Even when it turned out it was not Dume at all, they had obeyed his orders without question. Why, then, were they now being drawn into the heart of a vortex of darkness?</p>
			<p>"It is time you made good on your promises, my captains," Makuta said as the two vanished into the pulsating shadow. "For this is your eternal duty."</p>
			<p>With its insectoid legs acting as oars, the Vahki transport moved through the silver sea. Up ahead lay the Great Barrier, a cliff so high it vanished into the sky and so wide it encompassed the entire horizon.</p>
			<p>Vakama was paying no attention to the barrier though. His mind was lost in another vision...</p>
			<p><i>Bright light. Then darkness, the same kind of darkness that now shrouded all of Metru Nui. He looked around, uncertain, wondering how he would ever escape. Then a sliver of illumination appeared, like a crack in the shadows. It beckoned him to go forward, for on the other side was a place of safety...</i></p>
			<p>Vakama's eyes snapped open. He wasn't certain just what the vision meant, not yet, but he did know it was a sign of hope. That same instinct told him the Mask of Power he had been creating would play some part in all this, so he went back to work on it.</p>
			<p>Matau looked on, disapprovingly. In the middle of this crisis, Vakama was still playing mask-maker? "It is time you realized you are a Toa," he said.</p>
			<p>"Time? Of course!" said Vakama. "More time! That is what the false Turaga wanted!" Now he worked even more frantically on his mask. It was almost finished, and if he was right about what it could do-</p>
			<p>Vakama's thoughts were interrupted by another violent tremor. But this one was not caused by thunder in the ground. No, this came from the impact of a winged figure landing hard on a rocky outcropping of the Great Barrier.</p>
			<p>The Toa stared in wonder, in awe, in fear. This was unmistakably Makuta, but not Makuta as they had ever known him. This was a colossus in dark, infected armor, with the mighty wings of Nivawk, radiating the power of shadow. Worse, the Toa Metru could see that the tools of Nidhiki and Krekka were a part of his new form as well.</p>
			<p><i>No wonder they stopped chasing us,</i> thought Nuju grimly.</p>
			<p>Makuta looked down upon the Toa. Over the crashing of the waves and the howling wind, he snarled, "Your journey must end."</p>
			<p>"By the will of the Great Spirit, it has just begun!" roared Vakama.</p>
			<p>"Then conquer the real sea of protodermis!" said Makuta.</p>
			<p>With a wave of his arm, great pillars of crystalline protodermis rose from the sea, forming a dangerous obstacle course. Matau struggled with the controls as he steered the craft around them, but the Vahki transport was not designed for complicated maneuvers at sea.</p>
			<p>Vakama pointed up ahead. There was a narrow gap in the Great Barrier through which light shone, just like the image he had seen in his vision. "Keep to the light, Matau. The future is in your care," he commanded. Then he turned to the Toa of Ice and said, "Get me as close to him as you can."</p>
			<p>The Toa of Ice nodded as his mask began to glow. His telekinetic power reached out and lifted Vakama into the air, sending him hurtling up toward where Makuta waited.</p>
			<p>Down below the Toa fought on. Onewa jumped from the craft to smash one pillar to fragments with his proto pitons. But two more rose up dead ahead, so close their spikes ground together. The transport was on course to smash into them.</p>
			<p>"We need to quick-turn!" said Matau.</p>
			<p>Nokama slung her hydro blade and dug it into the side of the pillar. Then she hung on with all her strength as Matau threw the transport into a sharp turn, narrowly avoiding the barrier up ahead. But victory had not been won-another pillar rose up abruptly, crashing into the transport and sending the silver spheres flying into the sea.</p>
			<p>Nokama spotted them floating toward certain destruction. "The Matoran!"</p>
			<p>Nuju saw them as well, and it broke his concentration just enough to send Vakama plunging into the sea. But the Toa of Fire was not ready to give up. He dragged himself from the water and scaled the cliffside to face Makuta.</p>
			<p>The two circled each other warily. Vakama reached into his pack and produced the completed Mask of Power he had fashioned from the Great Kanoka disks.</p>
			<p>"The Mask of Time," breathed Makuta. Then the master of shadows smiled. "You are a great mask-maker, Vakama. You could have many destinies."</p>
			<p>Vakama hesitated. Makuta, sensing his doubt, moved in closer. "Fire and shadow are a mighty combination. Come join my brothers and I, Vakama."</p>
			<p>The Toa of Fire smiled. "I desire but one noble destiny," he said, placing the Mask of Time over his own Kanohi mask. "More than any power you can offer me."</p>
			<p>"Then accept your doom," thundered Makuta. He gathered his energies and sent a serpentlike stream of dark energy from his chest straight toward Vakama.</p>
			<p>The Mask of time glowed. A wave of temporal force flowed from it, striking Makuta. The movements of the master of shadows slowed, as did his energy stream, which now hung almost motionless in mid air.</p>
			<p>Stripped of Makuta's control, the sea calmed. The five Toa down below quickly went to work retrieving the Matoran spheres. None of them noticed that Turaga Lhikan was missing.</p>
			<p>Although he wore the Mask of Time, Vakama's control of it was imperfect. He was unable to stop the same temporal wave that slowed Makuta from slowing himself as well. He could feel his mind and body slowing down-and now there was no way to dodge the tentacle of dark energy heading for him.</p>
			<p>Then there was motion. Turaga Lhikan was running up to Makuta and Vakama, diving into the temporal wave right in front of Makuta's dark energy. The energy bolt struck Lhikan head on, shattering the shield created by his own mask. Lhikan was drained of all color as the darkness took hold. The disruption of the wave broke its power, and sent Vakama's Mask of Time flying into the sea.</p>
			<p>Vakama knelt over the dying Turaga, saying, "That was meant for me."</p>
			<p>"No," Lhikan responded weakly. He gestured toward the Great Barrier. "This is my lifetime's journey. Yours lies beyond."</p>
			<p>Vakama struggled with the feeling of grief that threatened to overpower him. He leaned in close to hear Turaga Lhikan's whispered words.</p>
			<p>"Trust your visions," the Turaga said. "I am proud to...have called you brother...Toa Vakama."</p>
			<p>With that, Lhikan's eyes went dark and his heartlight ceased to flash. Broken-hearted, Vakama removed the Turaga's mask, even as the shadow of Makuta fell upon him once more.</p>
			<p>"Fool!" snapped Makuta. "Without the Mask of Time, it will take a lifetime to achieve what destiny demands. But your lifetime will be brief."</p>
			<p>Makuta launched another tendril of dark energy at Vakama, forcing the Toa to scramble for safety. Then Vakama's mask suddenly began to glow and his body faded from view. He had become invisible!</p>
			<p>Makuta fired more blasts wildly, but missed the Toa by a wide margin. Vakama hurled a rock, sparking another blast from Makuta at the point where it landed. Then the master of shadows aimed at the point from which the rock came, his dark energy forcing Vakama into a hollow of the cliff.</p>
			<p>The Toa of Fire removed his disk launcher and wedged it hard into a crevice on the cliff face. As soon as the launcher was separated from him, it became visible. Makuta smiled and sent a tentacle of dark energy to grab it.</p>
			<p>"You cannot hide from me, Toa!" said Makuta.</p>
			<p>"I don't need to anymore," Vakama replied.</p>
			<p>The shadow wrapped around the launcher and tried to pull it toward him-but Vakama had wedged it in too deeply. Makuta found himself struggling with the power of the Great Barrier itself. Instead of the launcher being drawn toward him, he was being drawn toward the Barrier.</p>
			<p>Vakama returned to visibility as Makuta slammed into the cliff. Dazed, but still defiant, the dark one snarled, "If Toa Lhikan could not defeat me alone, how can you?"</p>
			<p>"Because he is not alone!" The voice was Nokama's. The six Toa stood together once more.</p>
			<p>The Toa raised their tools, with Vakama substituting his firestaff for his disk launcher. Their six elements flowed together to form a beam of pure white energy, which they hurled at Makuta, leeching his shadow power from him. A shell of protodermis formed around the master of shadows, sealing him in. With a final burst of power, the beam marked his prison with the sign of the Toa.</p>
			<p>The Toa broke formation and the power beam ceased. Vakama looked at Lhikan's mask and saw the streak of a star reflected in it. "Look skyward!" he said.</p>
			<p>The Toa turned their eyes to the heavens. Lhikan's spirit star was shooting across the darkened sky. As they watched, it exploded into six new stars.</p>
			<p>"Six spirit stars..." said Vakama.</p>
			<p>"The Great Spirit proclaims it!" said Nuju. "We are Toa!"</p>
			<p>The six heroes raised their fists and clanked them together. Their trials were far from ended, they knew, but they would face them as heroes of Metru Nui.</p>
			<p>Vakama looked down from the cliff to see that all six spheres had been retrieved and lashed once more to the transport. "We'll return for the rest of the Matoran soon," he said. "But first let us ensure the safety of those we have with us now."</p>
			<p>Much time would pass before the Toa Metru would first set foot on the island that lay far beyond the Great Barrier. An even greater span of time would go by before they returned again with as many Matoran as they could rescue from Metru Nui. In that time, the Toa would fight many battles, make new allies and confront powerful new enemies. They would learn lessons about heroism and sacrifice that would never be forgotten.</p>
			<p>Now, after so very long, they at last stood on the beach. Hundreds of silver spheres littered the sands. The Matoran within them still slept.</p>
			<p>"Toa Lhikan sacrificed his power for us," said Vakama. "Now we shall do the same for them."</p>
			<p>Vakama placed his hand on one of the capsules. His mask began to glow brightly.</p>
			<p>"May the heart of Metru Nui live forever," he said solemnly.</p>
			<p>Power flowed from him and the other Toa, spreading like a blanket of pure energy over the capsules. One by one, the eyes of the Matoran snapped open, their heartlights began to flash, as awareness returned to them. By the sacrifice of the Toa, they had been brought back to waking life.</p>
			<p>The heroes looked at one another. They were Toa no longer-by giving up their power to save others, they had become six Turaga. They watched with happiness and pride as the spheres opened and the Matoran emerged.</p>
			<p>"This is the island of Mata Nui, in honor of the Great Spirit," proclaimed Vakama.</p>
			<p>The Matoran looked around at the beach, the ocean, the trees-it was all so very new to them. One Matoran, Takua, ran up to Vakama and directed his attention to another. It was a Ta-Matoran named Jaller whose mask had been badly damaged in the transport.</p>
			<p>Vakama looked at Turaga Lhikan's mask. Then, smiling, he removed Jaller's damaged Kanohi mask and replaced it with Lhikan's. Rejuvenated, Jaller rose to join his friends. A Ga-Matoran named Hahli rushed to embrace him and welcome him to the Matoran's new home-the island of Mata Nui.</p>
			<h2>Epilogue</h2>
			<p>"And so it was as it is," said Turaga Vakama.</p>
			<p>The assembled Turaga, Matoran, and Toa Nuva looked on as he placed the stone that represented the Great Spirit in the center of the sand circle once more.</p>
			<p>"Matoran into Toa, Toa into Turaga, Turaga into legend. Remembering deeds past and bringing hope to the future. United in duty. Bound in destiny. This is the way of the Bionicle!"</p>
			<p>And so it was, and so it ever shall be.</p>

			<h1>BIONICLE Adventures #5: Voyage of Fear</h1>
			<h3>Greg Farshtey</h3>
			<h2>Introduction</h2>
			<p>Tahu, Toa Nuva of Fire, was troubled. He stood, as he had for many hours, on the steep slope of the Mangai volcano. His eyes scanned the terrain below him, observing dozens of Matoran hard at work. But nowhere in the crowd did he spot the being he wished to see.</p>
			<p>The sun had risen and set twice since Turaga Vakama had completed his last tale. It had been an amazing story of how six Toa Metru had risked great danger to save the Matoran from a terrible plot. Despite shocking betrayal and the tragic death of a great hero, they had succeeded in helping the residents of Metru Nui escape from the doomed city.</p>
			<p>Although his tale had revealed many secrets, it had left many more mysteries unsolved. When the Toa Metru left the city, they carried only six Matoran with them. These six, like the rest of the city's population, had been rendered unconscious by the evil Makuta and placed inside silver spheres. Yet there were more than six Matoran on Mata Nui-how had they made their way to the island? And what had happened to all the rest who had lived in Metru Nui?</p>
			<p>The answers remained elusive, because Turaga Vakama had vanished. No Toa or Matoran had seen the village elder in days. After much debate, Tahu, Gali, and Pohatu had agreed to stay on guard against any threat, while Takanuva, Kopaka, Onua and Lewa quietly searched the island.</p>
			<p>Tahu turned to see the Toa Nuva of Water approaching. "Any word?" asked Gali.</p>
			<p>"None, and I do not like this," said Tahu. "Turaga Vakama is the leader of my village. I should be out looking for him."</p>
			<p>"I understand. But of all Toa, the Matoran look to you for strength and inspiration. Seeing you nearby makes them feel secure. You know the others will do their very best. They will call if they need our aid."</p>
			<p>Kopaka's voice came from above and behind them. "I believe I have found our answer."</p>
			<p>Both Toa turned to see their friend traveling to greet them via ice bridge. Along with him came Turaga Nokama of Ga-Koro, Turaga Nuju of Ko-Koro, and Matoro, the villager who translated Nuju's peculiar language of grunts, whistles, and gestures.</p>
			<p>"There is no need for a search," Nokama said. "Vakama left to spend some time alone with his thoughts. He is safe and will return when his spirit is at peace once more."</p>
			<p>"Why would he leave without telling anyone?" demanded Tahu.</p>
			<p>"With your heart so full of questions, Tahu, would you have let him go?" Nokama asked. "He told myself and the others who fought beside him on Metru Nui. Now we are telling you, and asking that you respect how hard it has been for Vakama to relive the past through his tales. Give him his time."</p>
			<p>Nuju whistled and ran through a rapid series of hand gestures. Matoro nodded and said, "The Turaga says you have learned all you need to about Metru Nui. You should leave Vakama alone now."</p>
			<p>Gali shook her head. She looked directly at Nokama as she said, "No. We will not travel to the city of legends with mysteries hanging like a cloud over our heads. I respect the grief Turaga Vakama must feel, but it is more than time that we knew all."</p>
			<p>Nokama had always been known for her wisdom. She knew it was pointless to argue with Gali, but she had seen how tired and weak telling his tales had left Vakama. There was only one answer.</p>
			<p>"Very well, Toa of Water," she said finally. "Gather your brothers and I will tell you the next chapter of our story."</p>
			<p>That night, they assembled around a fire on the beach near Ga-Koro-seven Toa, five Turaga, Matoro, and Hahli, who now served as Chronicler for the Matoran. They waited in silence for Nokama to speak.</p>
			<p>"You must remember what had gone before," the Turaga of Water began, her voice little more than a whisper. "Metru Nui had fallen, shattered by storm and earthquake. All of the Matoran had been cast into a deathlike sleep from which we could not awaken them. But we had managed to take six of them, still in their spheres, with the intent to go back for the rest in the future."</p>
			<p>"Matau had been able to strap the spheres to the underside of a Vahki transport vehicle, making it seaworthy. Now we sailed through a crack in the Great Barrier, leaving Metru Nui behind in a desperate search for a place of safety for all the Matoran. But where we were going, and what dangers we would face along the way, no one could say..."</p>
			<h2>1</h2>
			<p>"I hate this," muttered Onewa. "I really do."</p>
			<p>The Toa Metru of Stone looked around. The other Toa were spread out on their makeshift boat, keeping an eye out for trouble. Matau was in the cockpit struggling to keep the modified Vahki transport on course. All of them were too busy to take notice of his complaint.</p>
			<p>"I said-" he began, more loudly.</p>
			<p>"We heard," replied Nuju, Toa of Ice. "Other than the fact that we are sailing through a narrow tunnel in a vehicle not designed for travel by water, which could sink at any moment...what is bothering you?"</p>
			<p>Onewa gestured at the other Toa. "This. All of this! Our city is in danger, the Matoran are imprisoned...and we are running away!"</p>
			<p>Nuju shook his head. "Our city is shattered, Onewa, possibly beyond repair. We are doing the only thing we can do-trying to find a place for the Matoran to begin again."</p>
			<p>"And that's another thing," grumbled Onewa. "Vakama says, 'Sail through the Great Barrier', and off we go. We don't even know where we're going!"</p>
			<p>"We are sailing to someplace far from Metru Nui, filled with new challenges and a new chance at life," answered Nuju. "The way will be long and filled with danger. We may not all survive to walk the surface of that land."</p>
			<p>"How do you know?"</p>
			<p>"The same way I know that you will not stop complaining until our voyage is over," said Nuju. "I know everything."</p>
			<p>Matau turned the wheel sharply to keep the transport from slamming into a rock wall. Even with the spheres keeping it buoyant and the insectlike legs of the vehicle acting as oars, this thing floated about as well as the average Po-Matoran. He had driven just about every kind of transport there was in Metru Nui at one time or another, but never anything that felt like such a disaster waiting to happen.</p>
			<p>Still, what choice did they have? They had defeated Makuta, just barely, but not before he had succeeded in draining the city's power plant of all energy. Tremors were rocking Metru Nui, bringing down buildings and chutes. Vahki order enforcement squads were all over, still trying to fulfill their last orders: Stop the Toa at all costs! Given all that, there really hadn't been time to stop off in Ga-Metru for a proper boat.</p>
			<p><i>Be a Toa-hero, I said,</i> Matau thought. <i>See exciting new places! Quick-save others! Almost get crushed by a giant plant and hard-stomped by Dark Hunters! What was I thinking?</i></p>
			<p>Whenua, Toa of Earth, had not spoken a word since the boat sailed through the Great Barrier and into the tunnel. Ordinarily, he would have been consumed by questions. Who had made this tunnel? Where did it lead? Were the lightstones that provided illumination a natural part of the rock walls, or had someone embedded them there?</p>
			<p>Archivists were always asking why. That was part of their job. Becoming a Toa Metru had not dulled that part of Whenua. In fact, it was memories of his past life that weighed on him. The Archives were behind him now, having suffered who knew how much damage in the earthquake. Exhibits might have been wrecked, or worse, their contents set free.</p>
			<p>Having spent most of his life as an Onu-Matoran, he knew his duty was to preserve and protect the living museum of Metru Nui. But as a Toa Metru, he had a greater obligation now. He had to serve and defend all the metru, not just his home. His friends were depending on him, and the sleeping Matoran were as well.</p>
			<p>But when he turned his eyes back toward the tunnel entrance, he could not help but wish that he had been in the Archives when the disaster struck. <i>That is where I belong,</i> he said to himself.</p>
			<p>	*	*	*</p>
			<p>Vakama, too, had been quiet since the journey began. He stood at the bow of the vessel, watching for dangers ahead. Nokama stood beside him, looking with wonder at their surroundings.</p>
			<p>"Have you ever pondered who built all of this, Vakama?" she asked. "The Great Barrier, this tunnel...were there Matoran in the dim past who constructed these things, or did the Great Beings themselves create them?"</p>
			<p>When Vakama didn't reply, she turned to look at him. There was a look in his eyes she had come to know all too well in their adventures together. No enemy could strike harder at Vakama than he struck at himself.</p>
			<p>"We did all we could," the Toa of Water said gently. "We saved those we could save, Vakama, and one day we will save all the rest. Toa Lhikan would have been-<i>was</i> proud of you."</p>
			<p>Vakama started at the mention of the Toa's name. Lhikan had been a hero of Metru Nui when these six had been simple Matoran. Betrayed and ambushed, he had sacrificed his Toa power to bring six Toa Metru into being. As a Turaga, he had aided them in their fight against Makuta. But it was his final memory of Lhikan which pained him the most-the noble figure taking a bolt of darkness meant for Vakama and perishing.</p>
			<p>"You're right, of course, Nokama. But I keep thinking Lhikan would have found a way to save the city from this cataclysm."</p>
			<p>"He did," Nokama replied. "He found us. Remember what he said? 'Save the heart of the city'. He knew the buildings and chutes and statues were not what mattered. It's the Matoran who gave life to Metru Nui, and the Matoran we must fight to save."</p>
			<p>Nokama placed a hand on his arm and smiled. "Any Ga-Matoran can tell you that you cannot sail a boat if you are looking behind all the time. You have to look ahead."</p>
			<p>"Then let's do that," said Vakama, "starting with this battered Vahki transport. It needs a name."</p>
			<p>He picked up his mask-making tool and swiftly seared a series of Matoran letters on the side of the craft. When he was done, Nokama leaned over his shoulder to see what he had written. It was one simple word:</p>
			<p><i>Lhikan.</i></p>
			<p>The voyage of the <i>Lhikan</i> had followed a pretty straight and level course so far. The tunnel widened as the Toa traveled further along. With no turnoffs, there was no way to go astray. But all that was about to change.</p>
			<p>Matau slowed the boat to a crawl. Up ahead, the tunnel forked. Both passages looked the same to him: dark, creepy, and about as inviting as the thought of being stranded in a broken chute with Nuju.</p>
			<p>"Which way?" the Toa of Air asked no one in particular.</p>
			<p>Nokama looked at Vakama. He was straining, but his visions of the future did not come on command. They appeared at random and he wasn't seeing anything now. "I don't know," he answered. "I'm not getting a feeling about either direction."</p>
			<p>"Too bad there are no carving-signs saying, 'This Way to Safe Spot'," said Matau. "I say we go left."</p>
			<p>"Why?"</p>
			<p>"Because we hardly ever go left," Matau answered, already turning the craft.</p>
			<p>"That...that is the most ridiculous reason to choose a future path I have ever heard," snapped Nuju. "The course of our mission is being decided by the Toa of Air's desire for variety?"</p>
			<p>"I say left," Matau repeated, smiling.</p>
			<p>The transport edged into the left passage. It was not even halfway through the tunnel mouth when the liquid protodermis all around began to bubble. The temperature shot up in a split second. Onewa glanced over the side and saw that the transport was starting to melt. He didn't even want to think about what might be happening to the Matoran spheres.</p>
			<p>"Back up!" he shouted. "Get us out of here!"</p>
			<p>Up ahead, something breached the waves with a powerful roar. The Toa Metru got a glimpse of bright green eyes, a massive body, a mouth large enough to swallow the transport whole, and skin that radiated intense heat. Then the creature crashed back beneath the boiling liquid.</p>
			<p>"Right. I definitely say right," Matau muttered, throwing the craft into reverse. Once it was out of the passage, he turned so hard he almost split the craft in two and shot into the other tunnel.</p>
			<p>"What was that?" asked Nuju, more stunned than he wanted to admit.</p>
			<p>"An illusion?" suggested Nokama. "Something to make us turn back?"</p>
			<p>Onewa shook his head. "The damage to the transport is real. My guess is the rest was real as well."</p>
			<p>"We'll take turns as lookout, then," said Vakama. "If there are things like that in here, we will need to be on our guard."</p>
			<p>Nokama signaled to Matau to stop the craft. "I am going to check on the condition of the spheres. If they stop to leak..."</p>
			<p>She didn't need to finish her thought. If the spheres leaked, the Matoran inside could drown. She leaped over the side and into the liquid protodermis. It was warmer than she expected, far more than the ocean around Metru Nui had been. It was also surprisingly clear, almost like the purified protodermis that flowed through Ga-Metru.</p>
			<p>She swam around the bottom of the transport, checking over each of the spheres. Apparently, they were well made, because it did not look like immersion in the boiling protodermis had done much harm. One of the transport's legs had almost melted clean through and would need repairs.</p>
			<p>Nokama was just about to go back to the surface when her eyes caught something gleaming on the tunnel bottom. She dove down for a closer look.</p>
			<p>It was a Rahi, quite dead, but not like anything she had seen before. Long and serpentlike, its body measured a good 65 feet in length by her estimation. Its tail was covered in spikes that measured a good three feet long. Even in death, it gave off an aura of amazing strength.</p>
			<p><i>What was this creature?</i> she thought as she swam rapidly for the transport. <i>And more importantly-what would have the power to kill it? Have we escaped the dangers of Metru Nui only to find something far worse?</i></p>
			<h2>2</h2>
			<p>Whenua turned his head slowly back and forth, his Mask of Night Vision illuminating every corner of the tunnel. There had been no further sign of any monstrous Rahi, but that did nothing to ease his mind.</p>
			<p>He knew he should share his suspicions about the two creatures, one living and one dead, encountered so far. But what if he was wrong? What if they were not the Rahi he remembered, and there was no connection to the project? Then he would not only have exposed one of the most closely guarded secrets in Onu-Metru, but he would have made a fool of himself in the process.</p>
			<p><i>No. If I'm wrong, then my silence does no harm,</i> he decided. <i>And if I'm right...I don't even want to think about that.</i></p>
			<p>The transport suddenly lurched with such violence that Whenua was almost thrown over the side. He turned to see Matau fighting the controls and the other Toa Metru scattered like fireflyer bugs in a stiff wind.</p>
			<p>"What in Mata Nui's name are you trying to do?"</p>
			<p>"We have to go back," Matau replied, as if it were the most obvious thing in the world. "We belong back in the city, doing our jobs. Hang on tight."</p>
			<p>The transport lurched again as Matau tried to force it into a U-turn in too narrow a space. Whenua recognized the toneless quality of the Toa of Air's voice, as well as the undercurrent of conviction that he was absolutely doing the right thing. Whenua glanced up, the light from his mask playing across the ceiling. That's when he saw them.</p>
			<p>"Vahki!" he shouted, pointing up. A squad of seven Nuurakh, the Ta-Metru order enforcers, were hovering just below the tunnel roof. Their Staffs of Command were deployed. One had already hit Matau with a blast, turning him into their obedient tool.</p>
			<p>Nuju fired a stream of ice at Matau. In a flash, the Toa of Air's arms were pinned to his sides. That left the transport with no driver as it spun in rapid circles. Nokama ran, flipped, and landed beside Matau to take over the controls.</p>
			<p>With no more reason to conceal themselves, the Vahki let loose with stun blasts. The Toa countered, Nuju using his elemental powers to create ice mirrors and reflect the energy bolts. Vakama tossed a spread of fireballs to give himself some cover. Then he rammed a low-powered Kanoka disk into his launcher and fired.</p>
			<p>The disk struck one of the Vahki head-on, immediately triggering the disk's "reconstitutes at random" power. As Vakama hoped, it scrambled the clockwork mechanisms inside of the Vahki, sending the enforcer into an uncontrolled plunge beneath the waves.</p>
			<p>Onewa reached out with his Mask of Mind Control, but being mechanical, Vahki minds were not vulnerable to the mask's energies. "Okay, we'll do it the hard way," said the Toa of Stone. Unleashing his elemental powers, he caused stone spikes to erupt from underwater, pinning three Vahki to the ceiling.</p>
			<p>"Crude, but effective," said Nuju. "But can you do this?"</p>
			<p>The Toa of Ice triggered his Mask of Telekinesis, tearing a huge chunk of stone from the ceiling. It slammed down onto a hovering Nuurakh, sending the Vahki spinning out of control. The mechanical being crashed into a wall and collapsed, its works shattered.</p>
			<p>Matau had broken free of his icy bonds and was struggling with Nokama. Whenua lumbered over and grabbed the Toa of Air. "Go see your friends," he said, hurling Matau into the air.</p>
			<p>The Toa crashed into the last two Vahki, stunning them both. Nokama maneuvered the transport underneath Matau and Whenua easily caught him as he fell. "There. This makes up for that time in the maintenance tunnels when you thought I let you fall," said the Toa of Earth. Then he turned to the other Toa and said, "Any idea what we do with the junior Vahki here?"</p>
			<p>Onewa nodded. Then he triggered his mask power, reaching into the mind of Matau. As a crafter, he knew just when a hammer was needed and when a more delicate tool would get the job done. He carefully applied the mask-energies to drive out the Vahki's influence.</p>
			<p>Matau shook his head like he had just awakened from a nap. "What happened? Why aren't we moving? And, um, why is Whenua carrying me?"</p>
			<p>"We flipped a disk," said Onewa, "and he lost."</p>
			<p>A small figure watched the Toa sail with a mixture of curiosity and fear in his eyes. He had never seen these Toa before. Who were they? Why were they here?</p>
			<p>His expression grew grim, for he could already guess the answers to those questions. Their fight with the Vahki had not fooled him. These six, whoever they might be, must have been sent by the city of Metru Nui. And they could only have come on such a dangerous journey for one reason: to capture him. They might even intend harm for his friends.</p>
			<p>Yes, of course. After all this time, no one had forgiven or forgotten. They were hunting him and the others again and would keep on doing so until they were stopped.</p>
			<p><i>I just wanted to be left alone,</i> he thought. <i>I didn't want to harm anyone. But they don't understand. No...it's not that they don't...they</i> refuse <i>to understand!</i></p>
			<p>He turned away and slipped into a narrow crevice, beginning the long journey home. Dark thoughts swirled in his brain, and from them a complex plan sprang.</p>
			<p><i>I will make them understand,</i> he vowed. <i>If I have to send their Toa back to them, crushed and defeated, to do it...then so it will be.</i></p>
			<p>"Are you certain about this?" asked Nuju.</p>
			<p>Nokama stood at the bow of their vessel, preparing to dive into the river. She had pulled Nuju aside a few moments before and whispered to him her intention of scouting ahead. Now the Toa of Ice looked at her with concern.</p>
			<p>"I realize I am the last person you would expect to call for all of us to stay together," said Nuju. "But we are facing completely unknown dangers here."</p>
			<p>"You're absolutely right," Nokama replied. After a pause, she added, "You <i>are</i> the last person I would expect to suggest that. Are you sure you're Nuju, and not another shapeshifting Rahi?"</p>
			<p>Nuju didn't crack a smile.</p>
			<p>Nokama shrugged. "I won't be gone long. The others probably won't even notice. I just wanted someone to know, in case..."</p>
			<p>"Yes," said Nuju. "In case."</p>
			<p>Without another word, Nokama dove into the water and swam away. He stared after her for a long time.</p>
			<p>Nokama plunged beneath the murky river. Although she did not have Whenua's night vision power, her eyes had become used to piercing the darkness underwater. She swam slowly, looking right and left for any sign of danger.</p>
			<p>The river teemed with little fish and some larger predators, but nothing of a size that would threaten a Toa. They seemed more frightened of her than anything else. She had expected more of the monsters that had appeared earlier, but so far this waterway seemed about as dangerous as the Archives aquarium.</p>
			<p>She surfaced to grab a breath of air. That was when she noticed the carvings in the wall of the tunnel. The action of the waters over time had worn them away to the point where they could not be read, so there was no way to be certain when they were made or why. But that still left the question-who had done this? Had someone else from Metru Nui made it through the Great Barrier in the past? Or did some other beings live in the world beyond, and this carving was their handiwork?</p>
			<p>She went back beneath the surface, this time looking for other carvings. Instead, she spotted what looked like a loose rock in the wall. On closer examination, she found that the stone was not only loose, but it was not even a natural part of the wall. Its edges were smooth, as if it had been carved in Po-Metru. Another of the same was fitted on top of it, and another, and another.</p>
			<p>Her eyes followed them up the side of the wall to the ceiling. The rocks were holding a much larger slab in place, but if they were to become dislodged...</p>
			<p><i>Someone rigged this,</i> she realized. <i>Replaced the stones in the wall with these so that the slab could be brought down on anyone journeying this way. But why? And who knows how many other such traps there might be?</i></p>
			<p>She turned and swam as fast as she could toward the <i>Lhikan</i>. The other Toa had to be warned.</p>
			<p><i>We are not alone here.</i></p>
			<p>Nuju still stood, watching for Nokama. Now and then he would create a small shower of ice crystals and toss them into the water. She had been gone too long. He would give her a minute more and then tell the others they had to launch a search.</p>
			<p>The transport lurched, swinging violently to the right. Nuju turned and saw Matau angrily striking the wheel and muttering to himself.</p>
			<p>"What's the matter?"</p>
			<p>"It won't go!" growled Matau. "Everything is working, but it is not swim-speeding."</p>
			<p>"Nokama understands watercraft better than any of us," said Vakama. "Where is she?"</p>
			<p>"She went for a swim," Nuju replied. Before the others could question him further, he said, "I will dive and check. Perhaps we are snagged on something."</p>
			<p>Nuju was not, in fact, that much bigger of a fan of water than were Matau and Onewa. But he preferred a swim in the river to having to explain where Nokama had gone and why he had not informed the others. He wasn't sure himself why he had respected her wishes. But she had earned his respect, which was not an easy thing to do.</p>
			<p>Below the boat, he found his diagnosis had been correct. A number of the legs that acted as oars were caught by some kind of seaweed. He used an ice dagger to cut some away and his Mask of Telekinesis to move a bit of the rest, but more always appeared. If he was going to clear the boat, he would need help.</p>
			<p>He kicked hard to propel himself to the surface, only to find that he wasn't moving up, but down. The seaweed had wrapped itself around his legs and torso and was dragging him toward the bottom. He tried to aim his crystal spikes to freeze the vegetation, only to have his arms pinned to his sides by the growth. Before he could react, a stray strand had yanked off his mask. Weakness flooded his limbs as the Mask of Power drifted to the bottom.</p>
			<p>Now he could see his final destination more clearly and the sight puzzled him. He knew his mind was cloudy due to the absence of the mask, but he could have sworn seaweed was a plant. Since when did it have huge jaws filled with knife-sharp teeth, gaping wide to devour a Toa?</p>
			<p><i>Since now,</i> he said to himself. <i>And weak as I am, there is no way I can stop it!</i></p>
			<h2>3</h2>
			<p>Vakama watched the water with worried eyes. Nuju had been down there too long and Nokama was still not back. If something was waiting down below, going in to rescue the Toa of Ice might just lead to another Toa's disappearance. But the alternative was to stand and do nothing, something Vakama refused to do. He knew all too well the consequences of inaction in the face of danger.</p>
			<p>The Toa of Fire had made up his mind to dive, when the vessel suddenly shot forward. His first reaction was relief. Nuju had obviously been successful and would be surfacing at any moment. This feeling faded in a hurry when he realized the boat was moving much too fast.</p>
			<p>"Matau! Slow down!" he shouted.</p>
			<p>The Toa of Air shook his head frantically. "I can't! It's not the transport that is quick-floating, it's the current!"</p>
			<p>A glance behind confirmed the Matau's statement. The liquid protodermis flowing through the channel was now a raging torrent propelling the transport along. Onewa and Whenua hung on as the boat careened off the walls. Vakama fought to keep his balance as he made his way to the cockpit.</p>
			<p>"Use your power!" he told Matau. "See if you can slow us down."</p>
			<p>Matau leapt onto the bow of the vessel and used his Toa energies to call forth a windstorm. Gusts howled in the confined space, trying to force the boat back even as the current thrust it forward. Finally, the transport came to a halt, pinned between the two powerful forces.</p>
			<p>It was a stalemate that could not last. Vakama barely heard Onewa shouting something over the roar of wind and wave. He turned to see the seals on the ship giving way and the outer shell fragmenting. Much more of this and there would be no transport left.</p>
			<p>It never came to that. Matau staggered from the effort of maintaining the storm. The winds died down and the vessel began flying through the tunnel again. Vakama jumped into the cockpit and took the wheel.</p>
			<p>"Onewa, grab Matau!" he barked. "Whenua, I need you to-"</p>
			<p>The Toa of Earth wasn't listening. The archivist in him was looking with wonder at the river, whose current carried the boat along as if it were a toy. "It's incredible," he muttered. "This world never ceases to amaze me."</p>
			<p>Vakama buzzed Whenua's mask with a lukewarm firebolt. "That's what you think," snapped the Toa of Fire. "It's going to cease in about three seconds if we don't think of something!"</p>
			<p>Whenua turned. Looming before the transport was a massive whirlpool, more than large enough to swallow the boat and all its passengers. The <i>Lhikan</i> was dead on course for destruction.</p>
			<p>Nokama had almost made it back to the transport when the current hit her. Being a native of Ga-Metru, she had dealt with sudden undertow and freak tidal surges before. Before it could carry her too far, she dug her hydro blades into the rock walls to halt her progress. She was safe, but helpless to stop the <i>Lhikan</i> as it flashed past her.</p>
			<p>The Toa of Water was not ready to give up. She focused her elemental energies on the river, trying to force the current to reverse, or at least slow enough that the others would be all right. But the current was too powerful and the transport already too far away for  her to draw it back.</p>
			<p><i>This is like trying to empty the silver sea with a test tube,</i> she thought. <i>I should be able to master any natural tide...but what if this isn't natural? What if the same beings who rigged the traps up ahead are responsible for this too?</i></p>
			<p>Her thoughts were interrupted by a flash of white off to her right. It was followed by a wave of bitter cold that sent shivers through her frame. Either one by itself would have meant nothing, but together they made her instincts scream: <i>Nuju!</i></p>
			<p>The current was too strong to swim against. Nokama pulled one of her hydro blades free and dug it back into the wall, then did the same with the other. It meant pulling herself along at a painfully slow pace. At one point, her hand slipped from her Toa tool and the current slammed her into the wall. She fought to stay conscious and hang on to the other blade. Letting go would mean being swept away.</p>
			<p>Now a white object was shooting toward her through the water, followed swiftly by another. She couldn't tell what they were. She reached out as the first came near, grabbing it. It was Nuju's Mask of Power!</p>
			<p>Now the larger object had almost reached her. With both hands full, she threw her body out at a 90 degree angle from the wall and scissored her legs to catch Nuju. His speed through the water threw her off balance and both Toa collided hard with the wall. Nokama winced as her right arm was wrenched. It took everything she had not to lose her grip and doom them both.</p>
			<p>Without his mask, Nuju was so much dead weight. Nokama strained until she could fit the Kanohi back on to the Toa of Ice. Nuju's eyes glowed brighter and he immediately grasped the situation. He grabbed one of the hydro blades and used his power to create a shell of ice around the two Toa.</p>
			<p>"This will not last long," Nuju said. He coughed up some of the river water.</p>
			<p>Nokama gestured at the strands of seaweed still wrapped around Nuju's arms. "What is that?"</p>
			<p>"One of the river creatures wanted a cold meal," he replied. "The current changed its mind. Where are the others?"</p>
			<p>Nokama shook her head. "Nuju...they're gone. I saw the transport go by, but I couldn't..."</p>
			<p>Nuju put an arm around her. "Do not fear, Nokama. We will find them." <i>If they still exist to be found,</i> he added to himself.</p>
			<p>"I have had enough," said Onewa. "We are branded criminals, captured, imprisoned, saw our friends taken by Makuta and our city damaged beyond repair. Now we are about to lose our lives and the lives of the only six Matoran we could save."</p>
			<p>He turned to Whenua. "It stops now. And you are going to stop it."</p>
			<p>Whenua's eyes were fixed on the whirlpool. Despite Vakama's best efforts in the cockpit, the transport was still headed right for it. "What are you talking about?"</p>
			<p>"Just listen," said Onewa. "I have a plan."</p>
			<p>Vakama had given up on hoping to avoid the whirlpool. Now he was trying to calculate the best way to ride with it and minimize the damage to the transport and Matoran spheres. If the craft shattered, maybe they could still salvage most, if not all, the spheres before they were lost.</p>
			<p>Then he saw something rising from the water. Before his mind could even register what it was, the transport had struck the object and was flying through the air. The whirlpool passed beneath and then the transport dove, its momentum spent. It plunged bow first into the river, the water swamping the deck. The craft came close to capsizing before righting itself and bobbing back to the surface.</p>
			<p>"What in Mata Nui's name just happened?" said Vakama. He was too surprised even to notice that the current had calmed and the boat was no longer rocketing forward.</p>
			<p>"I did," Whenua answered, smiling broadly.</p>
			<p>"<i>We</i> did," corrected Onewa.</p>
			<p>"A little Toa power, and instant earth ramp-up and over we went," said Whenua.</p>
			<p>"My idea, of course," broke in Onewa. "The hard part was explaining the plan in time to make it work. So-" He gently tapped the Great Mask of Mind Control he wore.</p>
			<p>"You used the mask," said Vakama, hardly able to believe it. "You were directing his actions."</p>
			<p>"His Toa power. My mind," replied Onewa. "An unbeatable combination. By the way, Whenua, your brain is as cluttered as the Archives. How do you manage to think?"</p>
			<p>"I don't know," laughed Whenua. "I guess I am just used to having more than one thought at a time, carver. You should try it."</p>
			<p>"Then we're safe for now," said Vakama, not sounding as if he believed his own words. "We have to go back for Nokama and Nuju."</p>
			<p>Onewa glanced behind and shook his head. "No, we don't. Look!"</p>
			<p>In the distance, Nokama was heading their way using her hydro blades to pull her along. Above her, Nuju traveled via an ice bridge created with his Toa power. Both looked exhausted, but unharmed. They reached the <i>Lhikan</i> at the same time. Matau looked on, frowning, as Nuju helped Nokama onto the deck.</p>
			<p>"It's good to see you both," said Vakama. "But how did you avoid the whirlpool?"</p>
			<p>Nokama looked at the Toa of Fire as if he had lost his senses. "What whirlpool?"</p>
			<p>Vakama rushed to the stern of the vessel. Sure enough, the waters were dead calm. There was no sign the maelstrom had ever been there. But it had been real, and so had the rushing water, the damage to the boat proved that.</p>
			<p>He crouched down and stared into the water. The current had slowed and the whirlpool vanished just moments after the <i>Lhikan</i> would have been lost.</p>
			<p><i>Almost as if someone was controlling them. Someone who wasn't close enough to see what happened,</i> he thought. <i>Once they thought we had vanished into the whirlpool, there was no reason to continue it.</i></p>
			<p>He turned back to the others. "Someone tried very hard to kill us. Now that someone thinks we're all dead."</p>
			<p>Whenua and Matau looked surprised. Onewa shrugged, no longer able to be shocked by anything that happened to the Toa Metru. Nokama and Nuju nodded in agreement.</p>
			<p>"So what do we do about it, firespitter?" asked the Toa of Stone.</p>
			<p>"That's simple," answered Vakama, rising to his feet. "We're going to die."</p>
			<p>The <i>Lhikan</i> drifted aimlessly down the river. No Toa sat at the controls to keep it on course, nor was there anyone keeping watch for threats. In fact, there was no sign of life anywhere on the vessel.</p>
			<p>To an observer, it would have appeared there had been a great struggle on board. One of Matau's aero slicers was embedded in the cockpit. Other parts of the craft were scarred by heat and ice blasts. The story was there for anyone to read: Some great force had overwhelmed the Toa Metru and swept them away, no doubt to their doom.</p>
			<p>But if that observer's eyes had been able to see through the solid walls of the transport, quite a different tale would have unfolded before him. Six Toa Metru huddled inside the cramped hold, listening intently to the noises from outside.</p>
			<p>"Do you hear anything?" Nokama whispered to Vakama.</p>
			<p>The Toa of Fire shook his head, frustrated. He had been certain that if it appeared he and the others had been lost in the whirlpool, their mysterious foe would reveal himself. Of course, that assumed their enemy had some use for the ship and some need to confirm their deaths. If that wasn't the case, he could just leave the <i>Lhikan</i> to drift.</p>
			<p>Onewa was saying something, but the words sounded like they were coming from far away. Vakama's mind had spun into another of his visions, brief glimpses of the future...or was it the past?</p>
			<p><i>Monstrous Rahi, ancient when Metru Nui was young...driven from their home waters...jaws opened wide...tentacles reaching, reaching...</i></p>
			<p>The craft spun, then lurched violently from side to side, shocking Vakama awake. They were no longer moving forward, he realized. They were going down!</p>
			<p>Onewa sprang to his feet and tried the makeshift hatch, but it was stuck fast. They could all feel the change in pressure as the transport sank rapidly. Nokama used her power to summon an undersea wave to lift them back to the surface, but whatever force was pulling them down was too strong.</p>
			<p>A crack appeared in the hull beside Nuju. River water began to leak slowly in, rapidly joined by other leaks in other portions of the hold. Already the liquid was up to the Toa's ankles and rising.</p>
			<p>"Vakama, burn a hole in the hull," said Nokama. "We have to get out of here."</p>
			<p>"If I do that, the <i>Lhikan</i> is lost," Vakama replied, "and so are the six Matoran spheres. There has to be another option!"</p>
			<p>The transport shuddered violently as it struck the bottom of the waterway. The Toa Metru scrambled to hang onto something to keep from being slammed around the hold. The hull of the craft groaned as the increased water pressure threatened to cave it in.</p>
			<p>"Don't look now, Toa of Fire," said Onewa. "But I think we just ran out of options."</p>
			<p>The octopoid beast that held the <i>Lhikan</i> in its grasp carefully examined its catch. This strange thing did not belong here, so it had to be stopped. But now that the Rahi had the hard object, it was not sure what next to do. This thing did not live or breathe; it was not food; it had not even provided sport by trying to get away.</p>
			<p>The Rahi's dim brain realized that this catch was of no use at all. Still, if allowed to escape, it might be an obstacle in the future. Better to avoid that by destroying it now.</p>
			<p>The creature's tentacles began to squeeze the <i>Lhikan</i>, with enough force to shatter the ship to splinters...</p>
			<h2>4</h2>
			<p>Mavrah stepped into the vast cavern, feeling a mixture of satisfaction and sadness. Given the choice, he would have preferred to simply scare those intruders away rather than harm them. But he knew enough about Toa to know they never gave up, not even in the face of overwhelming force. Certainly, Toa Lhikan had never flinched before any threat. Strange that he hadn't been among these strangers?</p>
			<p>Still, it was good to know his inventive genius had not deserted him after all these years. The whirlpool had worked perfectly. Of course, he hadn't waited to see the intruders' boat wrecked by it. There would have been no joy in that.</p>
			<p>For a moment, Mavrah was lost in his memories. He could remember long days spent in the Archives, talking with Nuparu about their newest ideas for inventions. Nuparu was determined to one day perfect a new mode of transport to replace chutes, if only to knock the Le-Matoran down a few pegs.</p>
			<p>For his part, Mavrah had simply wanted to better understand the Rahi. It frustrated him that so many of the creatures had to be kept in stasis in the Archives, where little could be learned of them. How could a researcher study the behavior patterns of creatures who were always asleep? Sometimes he had fantasized about smashing open the stasis tubes just to see one of those magnificent Rahi move again.</p>
			<p>Mavrah jumped as a great serpentlike creature snaked down from a stalactite and brushed against him. The Rahi was on its way to the water, a trip that would take some time given that the beast was over 40 feet long from head to tail. "Mustn't scare me like that," Mavrah said gently. "I might have thought it was another Toa, come to bring us all back."</p>
			<p>The Onu-Matoran turned as two mechanized beasts entered from side passages. They took no notice of him, but instead took positions on either side of the serpent. They would make sure it got to the pool without incident and without being observed by any intruders. Where one group of Toa had come, more might follow.</p>
			<p>Mavrah walked across the cave and stood at the edge of the vast pool. Beneath its calm surface lived countless creatures, remnants of an age long before Metru Nui. Powerful, unpredictable, dangerous beyond measure, they were still Mavrah's only friends in this desolate place. And no one-<i>no one</i>-would take them away from him.</p>
			<p>One of those "friends" was busy at the moment trying to crack open the <i>Lhikan</i>. The octopoid Rahi had found the Vahki transport a tougher target than it expected, but it was only a matter of seconds before the hull gave way.</p>
			<p>Suddenly, the transport began to glow red. An intense shock of searing heat forced the Rahi to let go, allowing the craft to bob back up to the surface.</p>
			<p>Slowly, the glow faded. A few moments later, the hatch opened and the Toa Metru emerged on the deck. Vakama stumbled and almost fell before Nokama caught him. "Take it easy," she said.</p>
			<p>"That was the hardest stunt I have ever had to pull," said Vakama. "So much heat without flame...but it worked."</p>
			<p>"I wonder what it was that strong-pulled us down?" asked Matau. "And where is it now?"</p>
			<p>A massive tentacle erupted out of the water, wrapping itself around Matau and hauling him off the transport. "When will I quick-learn to stop asking stupid questions?" shouted the Toa of Air, just before he disappeared beneath the waves.</p>
			<p>As one, the Toa Metru dove in after him. A swipe of a tentacle sent Nuju flying through the water. A second tentacle grabbed Vakama. Nokama turned to rescue the Toa of Fire, but he waved her off.</p>
			<p>In a moment, she saw why-or rather, she didn't see. Triggering the power of the Mask of Concealment, Vakama faded from view. The Rahi was puzzled. It could feel something in its grip, but not see anything. Its grip slackened just enough for Vakama to slip through, reappearing beside Onewa.</p>
			<p>Matau was in bad shape. He hadn't been able to grab a breath of air before being pulled under and was rapidly drowning. Worse, the Rahi had started to swim away with its prey. Onewa glanced at Whenua, who nodded. Then both unleashed their elemental power, forming hands of earth and stone that reached up from the bottom to grab the creature.</p>
			<p>Nuju rocketed forward, using both his elemental and mask energies. Bolts of ice and stone hurled telekinetically battered the beast. Stunned, it let go of Matau. Nokama caught him and rushed him to the surface.</p>
			<p>Onewa and Whenua released the struggling Rahi and the creature swam away. Vakama gestured urgently for the Toa to head back to the transport.</p>
			<p>They were still climbing aboard when the Toa of Fire shouted, "Matau! We need to go now!"</p>
			<p>Nokama and Matau looked at him, surprised. But the Toa of Air could tell this was no time to argue. He leapt into the cockpit and started the craft moving forward.</p>
			<p>"We are going after the beast," Nuju said to Vakama. It wasn't a question.</p>
			<p>"Yes, we are," the Toa of Fire replied. "It's time we became the hunters."</p>
			<p>From a hiding place nearby, six pairs of audio receptors recorded Vakama's words. Six pairs of optical sensors studied the Toa Metru, their strengths, their weaknesses, and their current condition. Complex clockwork mechanisms began to analyze, evaluate, and plan the ideal time to strike.</p>
			<p>One of the six beings turned away and began the trek back home. In any conflict, defeat was an option. Logic dictated that the information gathered should therefore be relayed to others for future use if necessary. This unit would return to Mavrah to do just that while the others pursued and apprehended the intruders.</p>
			<p>Had these beings possessed muscles, they would have felt them tense in anticipation of the conflict to come. If blood coursed through their veins, it would have flowed that much faster at the thought of battle after so many years of inactivity. But instead, they could only stare at the Toa with cold calculation. There would be no anger or hatred in their attack-just pure, precise, efficient destruction.</p>
			<p>Nuju stood at the bow of the ship. The telescopic lense built into his Mask of Power was focused on the wake of the octopoid beast. Nokama stood beside him, prepared to continue the pursuit underwater if the creature chose to dive.</p>
			<p>Near the cockpit, Vakama and Onewa strategized. Despite their disagreements, the two Toa had developed a grudging respect for each other. If Vakama still had is moments of doubt, and Onewa still thought with his mouth too often, they remained the best tacticians among the Toa. Whenua had been invited to join their council, but had refused, preferring to keep to himself.</p>
			<p>All of the Toa turned at Nuju's cry. The river had opened up into a vast waterway, even wider than the Po-Metru Sculpture Fields. The Rahi they were chasing had vanished into its depths, but no one even noticed. Their eyes were on the dozens of monsters breaching the surface and bellowing their anger at the <i>Lhikan</i>.</p>
			<p>Nokama had lived by the silver sea all her life. Between her explorations underwater and her visits to the Archives she had seen every kind of aquatic creature in existence, or so she believed. But never had she seen anything like this in the flesh. Before her startled eyes, serpents almost as long as the Coliseum was high reared up out of the water. Bizarre creatures looking like oversized sea slugs slithered along the rocky coastline. Massive fish leapt high into the air, lightning bolts lancing from their razor-sharp fins.</p>
			<p>The sight of so many previously unknown Rahi was beautiful, in a way, but it was a savage beauty. To the right, a reptilian creature rose out of the water with a Tarakava squirming in its huge jaws. On the left, a Rahi much like the one the <i>Lhikan</i> had been chasing struggled helplessly in the grasp of two gigantic crablike creatures.</p>
			<p>"This is...amazing," Nokama said softly.</p>
			<p>"This is insane," replied Nuju.</p>
			<p>"You're both wrong," said Whenua. "This...this is a disaster."</p>
			<p>"Maybe we should quiet-sneak away, before they decide we are fish food," offered Matau.</p>
			<p>Vakama shook his head. "No. We have nothing to turn back to-only a dark and dead city, filled with sleeping Matoran who are counting on us to find them a haven. If that means crossing these waters, then that is what we will do."</p>
			<p>"I hate to say it, fire-spitter, but you're making a lot of sense," said Onewa.</p>
			<p>"Why do you hate to say it?"</p>
			<p>"Ruins my image," said the Toa of Stone.</p>
			<p>Mavrah watched the mechanized Kralhi's approach. He knew it wouldn't have returned alone unless it had news, most likely bad news.</p>
			<p>As a Matoran, it was hard for him to see the machine creature without a trace of fear. Long before the Vahki enforcers were put into operation in Metru Nui, the responsibility for law enforcement fell on the shoulders of the Kralhi. They were well-equipped for the task. Their stingerlike tails were capable of projecting a force bubble around a target. Once inside, the target was rapidly drained of energy, all of which was fed back into the Kralhi. This left whoever the Kralhi had captured far too weak to cause any trouble.</p>
			<p>That, as it turned out, was the problem. The point had been to get Matoran troublemakers or those who walked off the job back to work as soon as possible. The Kralhi left them so weak and dizzy that they couldn't work for days. It was finally decided that they had to be shut down and replaced.</p>
			<p>Saying that and doing it proved to be two very different things. To this day, no one was sure how much self-awareness the Kralhi might possess, but they certainly resisted being turned off and scrapped. The Matoran were successful with a few of them, but most fought back hard. With the help of the newly built Vahki, the Matoran achieved a victory of sorts by driving the Kralhi out of the city. No one knew, or cared, where they had disappeared to as long as they were gone.</p>
			<p>Mavrah had been terrified the day he stumbled upon them, sure they would attack and force him back to the city. But the Kralhi had made no threatening moves. Over time, Mavrah realized that their primary purpose-to serve and protect Matoran-was still in force. As long as he did not make any effort to harm them or turn them off, they were perfectly willing to accept and serve him.</p>
			<p>Now the Kralhi paused in front of him. When it spoke, it was with the recorded voice of one of the Toa: "It's time we became the hunters." Then the machine waited for a response.</p>
			<p>Mavrah hesitated. He had tried to destroy these Toa and had been sure he succeeded. If they still lived, then it must be Mata Nui's will that they do so. Mavrah wondered if it was a sign. Perhaps if he explained to the Toa why he was here, and why he had to stay, they would understand. Then they could return to Metru Nui and inform Turaga Dume to call off the search.</p>
			<p>"Return," Mavrah ordered the Kralhi. "Capture the six Toa and bring them back here alive."</p>
			<p>The Kralhi simply stared, as if it had not understood anything that was said. Mavrah knew the creature was just being willful and stubborn.</p>
			<p>"Alive," he repeated, firmly. "Unharmed. That is a direct command. Now go."</p>
			<p>The Kralhi turned and departed. Mavrah thought he detected something in the way it moved, but he dismissed the idea. <i>A Kralhi is just a machine,</i> he reminded himself. <i>It can't feel disappointment...can it?</i></p>
			<p>Unfortunately, not everything shared Mavrah's newfound desire for the Toa's safety. The <i>Lhikan</i> had made it about halfway across the lake before attracting the attention of the local wildlife. Now the beasts were shoving each other aside in a race to see who would get to devour the craft and occupants first.</p>
			<p>The Toa had acquired one ally, a massive, tentacled whale that was now running interference for them. Onewa's Mask of Mind Control had worked on Rahi before, and this one had just enough of a mind to give him something to manipulate. Unfortunately, it meant the Toa of Stone could do nothing else to help to defend the vessel, but the others did their best to pick up the slack.</p>
			<p>A horned beast wrapped itself around the hull of the boat. Its head swung up over the side of the deck, hissing at Nuju and baring its vicious fangs. The Toa of Ice muttered, "No, I don't think so," and sent twin frigid blasts from his crystal spikes. Frozen solid, the serpent sank to the bottom like a stone.</p>
			<p>On the other side of the vessel, entire schools of fish were launching themselves out of the water at the <i>Lhikan</i>. Matau had been using his elemental wind power to blow them away, until an inspiration struck him. Using the power of his Mask of Illusion, he transformed himself into a huge sharklike beast with three sets of jaws. Frightened, the schools dove back underwater, with the exception of one fish who landed on the deck.</p>
			<p>Matau glanced down at it. He had never been fond of marine life, and this was a particularly ugly specimen. <i>Has the same happy-smile as Makuta,</i> he thought. <i>Just what the world needs-a Makuta fish.</i></p>
			<p>Vakama was everywhere at once. Sea creatures, no matter how large, hated fire, and he had been able to drive away some of the more monstrous specimens. Those he could not stop were being battered by waves or grabbed by the sea bottom thanks to the powers of Nokama and Whenua. It seemed like the Toa might make it through, although Vakama wondered how they would ever be able to make a second trip this way with all the sleeping Matoran in tow.</p>
			<p>A huge wave swamped the vessel, almost washing Vakama into the lake. WHen it subsided, all of the Toa could feel that something was wrong. The craft was still afloat, but now listing badly to one side.</p>
			<p>"One of the spheres," Nokama said. "They must have taken one of the spheres! I have to go down there and-"</p>
			<p>"No!" Nuju grabbed her and kept her from diving. "I let you go once, not this time. You would not last more than a few seconds among these creatures, and you know it. If one of the spheres has been lost, we will recover it..."</p>
			<p>"When?" Nokama demanded. "Before or after some sea monster has dined on it?"</p>
			<p>"I know how you feel," said Whenua, as he caused chunks of the sea floor to pelt an oncoming Rahi. "Believe me. But we are almost to the other side of the lake. Once back in the tunnel, the creatures can only come at us one at a time. One Toa can hold them off while the rest of us-"</p>
			<p>"That will be too late!" said Nokama, wrenching free of Nuju's grasp. She raced to the edge of the deck.</p>
			<p>Vakama saw her and moved just as quickly himself. He threw up a wall of flame around the transport, cutting off the Rahi from approaching and Nokama from leaving. She turned on him, enraged.</p>
			<p>"Vakama, why-?"</p>
			<p>"We may have lost a friend," said the Toa of Fire. "I won't stand by while we lose another."</p>
			<p>Before Nokama could answer, she was suddenly lifted off her feet and into the air. Vakama looked at Nuju, thinking it was the Mask of Telekinesis at work, but the Toa of Ice was as surprised as anyone. That was when Matau noticed the energy bubble around Nokama. He struggled to see through the flames, finally spotting what he feared to find but knew had to be there.</p>
			<p>"Kralhi!" he shouted. "They have Nokama!"</p>
			<p>"Whenua, you and Onewa keep the Rahi at bay," ordered Vakama. "Nuju, Matau and I will save Nokama!"</p>
			<p>But Matau was already gone, encased in a Kralhi bubble and being spirited away. Nuju created an ice barrier to try and impede the bubble's progress, but a boulder hurled by the Kralhi weakened it badly. When Matau's prison struck it, the wall crumbled into the water.</p>
			<p>Now the Kralhi attacked in earnest, keeping the Toa off balance with a barrage of stones and energy bubbles. Onewa was the next to be captured, causing the Rahi he had mastered to dive beneath the water and disappear.</p>
			<p>The Toa fought valiantly, but attacked on two fronts and worn down with fatigue, they could not hold their own. Nuju had a perfectly aimed ice blast ready for a Kralhi when one of the Rahi rammed the transport, knocking him off his feet. The next instant, he was inside a Kralhi bubble and could feel his energy being drained away.</p>
			<p>Vakama and Whenua held out for a little longer, but eventually they too fell to the Kralhi. Vakama screamed with anger and frustration as he saw the now abandoned transport drifting toward the tunnel, still carrying its precious cargo. Then the hunger of the Kralhi for energy took its toll. Vakama's mind fell into a pool of darkness as unconsciousness claimed them all.</p>
			<h2>5</h2>
			<p>Nuju had not expected to awaken. If he ever did see the light again, he assumed it would be from inside a cell, or at least with the Toa in chains. But the reality proved to be very different.</p>
			<p>The first thing he saw when his eyes opened was the ceiling of a vast cavern. It was warm here, as if molten protodermis flowed underground to provide heat in the way it did in Metru Nui homes. He glanced around, trying not to move his head and give away that he was awake. He could see the other Toa, some stirring, some still unconscious. They were all lying on a comfortable bed of dried seaweed.</p>
			<p>He might have thought the whole thing was a bad dream if not for the presence of three Kralhi, obviously standing guard. Realizing they could not be fooled, he sat up. His mechanical parts were undamaged, but his biological components ached badly. It would take time to recover from the Kralhi's energy drain.</p>
			<p>The other Toa were now fully awake. Vakama started to get to his feet, but as soon as he did so, one of the Kralhi took a step forward. When the Toa of Fire sat back down, the guardian returned to its original spot.</p>
			<p>"I guess we won't be going for any walks," said Onewa. "Kralhi. I never expected to see those junk heaps again."</p>
			<p>"I say as soon as we are back to full strength, we make a run for the water and try to find the transport," said Nokama. "I didn't like those things when they patrolled Metru Nui. I like them even less here."</p>
			<p>Vakama looked around. Amphibious Rahi of enormous size crawled and slithered around the cave, but they all stayed well away from the Kralhi. It made no sense. Why would these creatures fear and obey mechanical beings, and why would the Kralhi wish to control Rahi in the first place? What were they even doing here?</p>
			<p>Whenua spotted a small figure coming toward them from the other end of the cave. Walking by his side was a medium-sized Rahi that looked like a cross between a lizard and a Kavinika, wolflike creatures from Po-Metru. The Toa of Earth paid little attention to the beast, though-his eyes were focused on the too familiar Matoran approaching.</p>
			<p>"You mustn't let my friends worry you," Mavrah said as he got closer. "They are just here to make sure you remain...reasonable."</p>
			<p>"We're always reasonable," Onewa shot back. "In fact, I can think of a bunch of reasons to turn you into a rock garden."</p>
			<p>Nokama gestured for Onewa to keep silent and said, "Who are you? Why have you brought us here? You have to let us go. Our mission is vital!"</p>
			<p>Mavrah chuckled. "Who am I? As if you don't know? I am aware of your mission, Toa-if that is what you really are. It is why I brought you here."</p>
			<p>Onewa reached out with his Mask of Mind Control powers and seized hold of Mavrah's thoughts. The Matoran stiffened, then said exactly what Onewa wished him to: "Then again, you are correct. I will set you free. The Kralhi will escort you out."</p>
			<p>The Rahi at Mavrah's side began to screech so loudly Onewa thought his mask would split. The Kralhi responded by launching weakness disks at each of the Toa. The power of the disk was enough to break Onewa's concentration and free Mavrah's mind.</p>
			<p>The Matoran shook his head as if waking up from a bad dream. "You...you mustn't do that again. My pet here is a most unusual Rahi, you see. He can sense the use of Kanohi mask powers, in the same way a Kinloka rat can sense food from a distance. And, as you have now discovered, my Kralhi are very well trained."</p>
			<p>The Matoran smiled. "Now, let us not waste time. My Rahi recovered your transport, yes, and those shiny spheres too...most remarkable creations. I am prepared to return them to you if you turn around, go back the way you came, and deliver a message to Turaga Dume for me."</p>
			<p>"That might be...difficult," Vakama replied. "But what's the message?"</p>
			<p>"Tell him to leave me alone!" Mavrah yelled, startling the Toa. There was an uncomfortable silence while the Matoran composed himself. Then he added, quietly, "I am fine. The Rahi are fine. We want nothing from Metru Nui, and Metru Nui should ask nothing of us."</p>
			<p>The Toa glanced at each other, none of them eager to be the one to tell the Matoran about the fate of Metru Nui. Finally, Whenua stood up. The Kralhi advanced automatically, but the Toa of Earth ignored them.</p>
			<p>"Mavrah, in Mata Nui's name...stop this," he said. The other Toa looked at him, shocked. Whenua knew this crazy Matoran?</p>
			<p>Whenua took a step toward Mavrah, then another. The Matoran waved the Kralhi off. "You are fighting a battle long over, against enemies that no longer exist," the Toa of Earth continued. "Metru Nui is no threat to you, my old friend, because Metru Nui is no more."</p>
			<p>Mavrah said nothing as Whenua told his tale. He related the story of the Morbuzakh's attacks on the city; the transformation of six Matoran into Toa Metru; the betrayal of the false Dume; and the deathlike sleep of all the Matoran. When he was finished, he waited for the Matoran's reaction.</p>
			<p>It wasn't long in coming, nor was it what Whenua had expected: Mavrah burst out laughing. "Lies," he said. "But amusing ones. Lhikan dropping off Toa stones like they were Naming Day gifts? Whenua, of all Matoran, a Toa? And Turaga Dume...oh, <i>forgive me</i>, Makuta...as sinister mastermind? Yes, very funny indeed."</p>
			<p>Mavrah's expression suddenly darkened. "The Whenua I knew was many things, but he was not a liar. That means you are not Whenua. I cannot trust you, any of you."</p>
			<p>The Kralhi advanced until they were crowding the Toa against the cavern wall. Mavrah came with them, his eyes fixed on Whenua. "I know there is no cell that could hold true Toa. But I am guessing that your ship means something to you or you would not have fought so hard to save it. Make a move to escape, or to harm me, and I will see it destroyed, along with those strange spheres. I want no trouble from the six of you-"</p>
			<p>Mavrah stopped abruptly. The Rahi by his side had begun to screech again. He examined the five Toa before him, and...five? He was sure there had been six of them. Yes, there had been six, which meant-</p>
			<p>"One of them has escaped!" he shouted. He gestured toward two Kralhi emerging from the shadows on the far side of the cave. "Find him! Bring him back!"</p>
			<p>The mechanical beasts turned and exited through a side tunnel. Nokama watched them go, nursing a hope that Vakama would manage to escape and find the transport. His Mask of Concealment had allowed him to fade from view while Mavrah was talking. The Matoran had been so upset he never noticed the shadow Vakama still cast even while invisible.</p>
			<p><i>Mata Nui, if you can hear me, help Vakama,</i> she thought. <i>The fate of all Matoran rests with him now.</i></p>
			<p>The Kralhi began their hunt, moving slowly and methodically through the only tunnel the stranger would logically have taken. His invisibility was at best an annoyance to them. Their more sophisticated sensors would surely be able to track him.</p>
			<p>Still, it was more than their absolute confidence in victory that added an intangible sense of excitement to this pursuit. It was something very simple, yet with potentially horrific consequences for the Toa of Fire: Mavrah had not said this one needed to be brought back alive.</p>
			<p>Vakama moved as quickly as he could. The problem with invisibility, he had discovered, was that he could not see himself either. It was no easy trick to run when he couldn't see his feet.</p>
			<p>He could hear the heavy footsteps of the Kralhi behind him. He had no idea if they would be able to see him or not, but was willing to gamble on the power of his Kanohi mask.</p>
			<p>Vakama had only one Kanoka disk left, a freeze disk of fairly substantial power. A plan started to form in his mind. One disk would be more than enough, if he used it correctly...</p>
			<p>He raced on, fitting the Kanoka in his launcher. Once he found the right spot for an ambush, the Kralhi were in for a big surprise.</p>
			<p>Matau eyed the Kralhi guarding them. The three of them were standing like statues, but he knew that they were primed to react to any movement. He silently calculated just what combination of flips and rolls it would take to get close to them. All he asked was the chance to put his aero slicers to work.</p>
			<p>"How long do we wait?" he whispered.</p>
			<p>"We give Vakama ten minutes," Onewa replied. "Then we move. Nuju, Whenua and I will distract the Kralhi. You and Nokama will grab Mavrah."</p>
			<p>"I never liked Onu-Matoran," muttered the Toa of Ice. "I like them even less now."</p>
			<p>"Don't blame him. You don't understand," said Whenua.</p>
			<p>"There's a lot we don't understand," Onewa shot back. "But I have a feeling you do. Maybe it's time you shared?"</p>
			<p>Whenua hesitated for a long moment. Then he nodded and began to speak.</p>
			<h2>6. Whenua's Tale</h2>
			<p>Long before the Morbuzakh, long before the actions of the false Dume, long before the coming of the Toa Metru, the city of Metru Nui was a place of peace and learning. Outside of the city-wide akilini tournaments in the Coliseum, the only real excitement was when Rahi beasts would appear on the outskirts. Then Toa Lhikan and the Vahki squads would go into action, driving off the creatures or trapping them for display in the Archives.</p>
			<p>Being an experienced archivist, it was not unusual for Whenua's day to begin with news of the latest captures. But on this particular day, the pounding on his door was more frantic. He went to open it, mouthing a silent wish that no exhibits had broken free and trashed an entire wing again.</p>
			<p>Onepu didn't even wait for the door to be fully ajar before slipping inside. His eyes were bright with excitement and his heartlight was flashing wildly. "It's amazing! You have to come see! No one knows, not even Toa Lhikan!"</p>
			<p>"Slow down," said Whenua. "You're talking faster than a Le-Matoran. Come see what? Were more Rahi delivered? Or did the miners find more of those Bohrok things?"</p>
			<p>"Better than that. But I can't explain. The Chief Archivist wants you, me, and Mavrah there right away."</p>
			<p>Onepu dashed back outside, with a confused Whenua following along behind. The last time the Chief Archivist wanted to see him, a few dozen ice bats had escaped from their tubes and infested the administrative offices. He hoped this time the meeting would not involve nets, boxes, or anything that flew.</p>
			<p>The trip took longer than Whenua expected. Onepu led him on a winding path to the Archives, through chutes that dove deep beneath the surface and emerged in sub-levels with which Whenua was only barely familiar. Then it was a long hike through abandoned tunnels to another chute, this one badly in need of repair, and another steep drop to a sub-level that didn't even show up on any Archives charts.</p>
			<p>"Where are we?"</p>
			<p>"Come on," said Onepu. "Wait until you see this."</p>
			<p>The two Matoran rounded a corner to behold a stunning sight. This sub-level consisted almost completely of water, and in that water were creatures out of an archivist's dream...or nightmare. There were huge, aquatic beasts, large enough to swallow a Muaka in one gulp. Nearby were monstrous crabs strong enough to crush stone in their claws. The sight of one such Rahi would have been shocking, but there were dozens and dozens of them here.</p>
			<p>Whenua did not know what to say. Onepu simply smiled. Mavrah was already there, just staring at the amazing display before him.</p>
			<p>"I told you," said Onepu. "Even the Chief Archivist was speechless."</p>
			<p>"Where did they come from?" asked Whenua. "What...what are they?"</p>
			<p>Mavrah turned at the sound of voices. "They appeared off the coast of Onu-Metru last night," he said. "It took Mata Nui knows how many Vahki squads to herd them in here. This was the only spot in the city big enough to hold them all."</p>
			<p>Whenua watched as one of the creatures surfaced long enough to reveal a Takea shark trapped in its jaws. Then it dove again, leaving little doubt what the fate of that unlucky sea beast would be.</p>
			<p>"There isn't a stasis tube big enough in all of-" Whenua began.</p>
			<p>"They aren't for exhibit." The three archivists turned to see Turaga Dume coming toward them. "The Chief Archivist has requested, and I have granted, permission for these creatures to be kept here for study. They will not be placed in stasis so that the three of you can learn from conscious specimens."</p>
			<p>All three of them thanked the Turaga. Dume waved them off. "Don't thank me. This is against my better judgment. Unleashed, creatures like these could destroy half the city. For that reason, this matter is to be kept a strict secret. I do not want a panic in the city, do you understand?"</p>
			<p>The archivists nodded. Never before had the Turaga knowingly allowed a danger to the city to exist within its borders. It was a little frightening to realize that not only the safety of the Archives, but perhaps Metru Nui itself, depended on how well they did their jobs.</p>
			<p>"What about Toa Lhikan?" asked Whenua. "Surely he must know."</p>
			<p>"No," answered Dume. "Lhikan's first duty is to the safety of the city, and he cannot see beyond that. But the advancement of Matoran science requires risk. I have been convinced that there is something that can be learned from these...monsters. Do not prove me wrong."</p>
			<p>A serpent that looked rougly the size of Po-Metru raised its head above the water and bellowed. The sound shook the sub-level.</p>
			<p>"And Mata Nui protect us all," said Dume as he walked away.</p>
			<p>	*	*	*</p>
			<p>The three Onu-Matoran soon settled into a routine. Early each morning, they would travel together to the Archives. Staying in each others' company helped them avoid talking with any other archivists who might be curious about their new project. They spent all day and most of the night observing and testing the strange sea creatures, noting down everything they could about the behavior and characteristics of the Rahi. Then they would return to their homes for an all too brief rest before starting all over again.</p>
			<p>Whenua and Onepu complained early and often that three Matoran were not enough to do this job well. But Mavrah insisted that secrecy was vital to the success of the project, and the Chief Archivist backed him up.</p>
			<p>Fatigue and overwork eventually took their toll. The three Matoran began to quarrel over the slightest thing. Notes were misplaced, experiments accidentally ruined, and at one point one of the Rahi almost slipped past both Onepu and a Vahki squad to make it back out to sea.</p>
			<p>That was enough to drive Mavrah to fury. "You idiot!" he shouted at Onepu. "Do you realize what might have happened if it escaped?"</p>
			<p>"He's right," Whenua said. "It might have turned toward the city and harmed Matoran before it was stopped."</p>
			<p>"Before it was stopped?" Mavrah repeated in disbelief. "Before it was killed, you mean, along with our entire project. Your stupidity could have led to this Rahi's destruction, a tragic loss to science-all because you weren't paying attention!"</p>
			<p>It took some time for the hard feelings left over from that incident to ease. But worse was yet to come, and this time on Whenua's watch. He had been concentrating intensely on a creature that looked something like a Tarakava, only with multiple flippers that might evolve into feet one day. Though not big enough to be a physical threat to its neighbors, it was able to defend itself quite well with the help of twin ice beams from its eyes.</p>
			<p>The Rahi was so fascinating that Whenua never saw a far larger beast erupt out of the water. Other creatures immediately moved to challenge it, but the monstrous serpent shrugged them off as if they were raindrops. It was sick of captivity. Now was the time to escape or die trying.</p>
			<p>The monster leapt out of the water and crashed into the stone ceiling. The impact violently shook the Archives, sending Whenua plunging into the makeshift holding tank. Before he could scramble back to safety, the Rahi struck again. This time the force of the collision cracked the ceiling and shattered displays even on the uppermost levels.</p>
			<p>Whenua had his own problems at the moment. He was <i>not</i> a strong swimmer. Worse, his neighbors in the water had noticed a newcomer in their midst, one with no claws or teeth to defend himself. This would be an easy meal, they decided, and began to circle the Matoran.</p>
			<p>The archivist desperately tried to remember anything he had ever heard about fending off sea Rahi attacks. In a panic, he realized it was a subject he had never discussed. Onu-Matoran didn't go for swims, after all. Only Ga-Matoran were that insane.</p>
			<p>One squid like Rahi reached out with its tentacle. Whenua frantically slapped it away. But he could already feel his arms and legs growing tired from treading water. He would run out of energy long before the Rahi ran out of interest. Then he would be just another archivist lost in the pursuit of knowledge.</p>
			<p>A shark moved in for the kill. Too tired to fight anymore, Whenua shut his eyes and waited for the end. But instead of a painful bite, he felt hands seize him and pull him out of the water. A second later, he was back on solid ground, coughing and gasping for air.</p>
			<p>Mavrah stood over him. "What were you thinking, diving in there?"</p>
			<p>"I decided I needed a bath," Whenua snapped. "You think it was my choice to be Rahi bait? The earth tremors knocked me in."</p>
			<p>"Those weren't tremors," Mavrah responded grimly. "One of our guests tried to escape. It's under control now, but...there was a lot of damage up above. A Kraawa broke free."</p>
			<p>Whenua winced. The Kraawa was an unusual Rahi who turned any force used against it into energy to grow. Hit it enough times and it would be bigger than the Coliseum. Getting it into the Archives had taken multiple Vahki squads and resulted in three levels being trashed. If it was loose...</p>
			<p>"How bad?" he asked.</p>
			<p>"A dozen Vahki smashed; three levels suffered critical damage, four more are being evacuated; at least a few hundred exhibits awake and on the loose. It's a disaster."</p>
			<p>"You have a gift for understatement, Mavrah."</p>
			<p>The words came from Turaga Dume. The elder was striding toward them, with the Chief Archivist running alongside, babbling apologies. Dume waved him away and looked directly at Mavrah.</p>
			<p>"This project is terminated," he said. "As soon as order has been restored in the Archives, the Vahki will drive these...these monsters back out of the city. A security zone will be established in the waters around Metru Nui. The Vahki have authorization to kill any of these Rahi who violates that zone."</p>
			<p>"No!" Mavrah shouted. "You mustn't do that! Think of the knowledge we will be losing, the potential for progress-"</p>
			<p>"This is not a debate," Turaga Dume replied. Then, in a softer tone, he added, "I am sorry, Mavrah. I know how much this project means to you. But I cannot jeopardize the safety of the Archives-or the city-further. These things do not belong here."</p>
			<p>Dume turned to the Chief Archivist. "See to it that the Vahki get any cooperation they require. I want these beasts gone by morning."</p>
			<p>That night was the longest Whenua had ever lived through. He couldn't help thinking that if he had been paying more attention, maybe this would never have happened. Of course, he couldn't say how he would have stopped a massive Rahi who wanted out, but that was beside the point. Now the Archives were half-wrecked and the project was shut down.</p>
			<p>He had tried to apologize to Mavrah for his mistake, but the Onu-Matoran was too upset to speak. He just stood there, staring at the Rahi, looking like he had lost his best friends.</p>
			<p>The next morning, Whenua returned to find the Archives under lock down. Vahki Rorzakh were everywhere, watching carefully as Onu-Matoran crews struggled to return Rahi to their stasis tubes. Inside, other crews used regeneration disks to repair structural damage. The sheer magnitude of the damage was staggering.</p>
			<p>He made his way down to the sub-level where the Rahi had been held. He expected to find it abandoned. Instead, it was filled with Rorzakh and a very worried Chief Archivist.</p>
			<p>"They're gone," the administrator said. "All of them. Disappeared."</p>
			<p>"Wasn't that the point?" Whenua asked.</p>
			<p>"You don't understand. The Rahi are gone, but the Vahki didn't take them. They escaped back to the sea somehow. The Vahki are bringing Onepu and Mavrah here now."</p>
			<p>A Rorzakh squad appeared a second later, shoving Onepu in front of them. A second squad was right on their heels, but empty-handed.</p>
			<p>"Where's Mavrah?" asked the Chief Archivist.</p>
			<p>The Vahki shrugged. Whenua had no doubt they had searched Mavrah's home and everywhere he might be hiding before returning to admit failure. Rorzakh were nothing if not thorough.</p>
			<p>"He must be on his way then," the Chief Archivist muttered, not sounding at all convinced that was the case. "I have already spoken with the Turaga. He is sending Bordakh and Rorzakh to find the creatures. Of course, the important thing is that they are gone. But I think we all want to find out how and why."</p>
			<p>Whenua said nothing. But he had a horrible suspicion he already knew the answers to those questions...</p>
			<p>The mystery of the missing Rahi was never solved. The Chief Archivist's official report to the Turaga stated that the creatures must have contrived a mass escape. The Vahki on duty had done nothing to prevent it because their orders were to see to it that the Rahi left. It made no difference to them how that happened.</p>
			<p>The report further stated that, in trying to stop the escape, Mavrah had been lost and was presumed dead. Although his sacrifice could not be publicly recognized without revealing the existence of the project, the sub-level would be renamed in his honor.</p>
			<p>Whenua always suspected that Turaga Dume knew more about what had happened than he let on. He called off the Vahki search for the Rahi after only a very short time, as if he knew they would not be found, nor would Mavrah. Whatever the Rorzakh knew about the situation, they communicated only to the Turaga.</p>
			<p>After a while, things returned to normal in the Archives. Whenua and Onepu both made an effort to forget all that had gone on. It was easier to simply accept the official report and mourn for their friend. After all, the only alternative theory of what happened that night was too far-fetched to ever believe.</p>
			<p>Or so they thought...</p>
			<h2>7</h2>
			<p>"But Mavrah wasn't dead," Nokama said slowly, still trying to comprehend what she had just heard. "He stole the Rahi somehow before the Vahki could move them."</p>
			<p>"Then wound up here, where he stumbled on the Kralhi," Onewa continued. "It's a community of outcasts."</p>
			<p>Nuju turned to Whenua, saying, "You knew all along. When we first encountered the beasts, you knew what they had to be."</p>
			<p>"I wasn't sure," said the Toa of Earth. "And...Mavrah saved my life. And he wouldn't be here if it weren't because of me-my mistake."</p>
			<p>"What's done is done," said Nokama. "But I think we should make a pact: In the future, no more secrets."</p>
			<p>Onewa chuckled. "Well, we know who the most optimistic Toa is," he said. "But it's the absent one who concerns me. Where in Mata Nui's name is Vakama?"</p>
			<p>The Toa of Fire was asking himself the same question. He had taken so many twists and turns he was not at all sure he could find his way back to the other Toa. But he had found a perfect spot to trap the two Kralhi on his trail.</p>
			<p>Now he was perched on a rocky ledge that afforded him a decent view of the tunnel. He would have to wait for both of them to approach before he could act, and then strike the rearmost machine first. The problem was by then they would be able to sense him too. Vakama held his breath and did his best to remain motionless.</p>
			<p>The sound of the Kralhi's footfalls grew louder and louder. A moment later, both of them came into view, walking in single file in the narrow tunnel. Vakama forced himself to wait for just the right instant.</p>
			<p>The lead Kralhi lifted its head, looking in his direction. Had it spotted him? There was no more time to delay. Vakama launched the freeze disk at the Kralhi in the rear at the same time as he hurled a blast of elemental fire at the lead machine.</p>
			<p>Ice and fire hit at the same time. The intense heat fused the components of the lead Kralhi, destroying its control centers. The Kanoka disk froze the other solid before it could react. The damaged Kralhi, its sensors blinded, stumbled backwards and smashed into its partner, shattering the second enforcer into a million icy fragments. Then it collapsed on the floor in a heap, sparks flying from its joints.</p>
			<p>Vakama dove from his hiding place and ran down the tunnel. Even at top speed, he barely made it clear before the Kralhi exploded.</p>
			<p><i>That should show Mavrah what I-what a Toa-can do,</i> he corrected himself. <i>If he has any sense, he'll surrender right now. Next time, I might not be quite so gentle.</i></p>
			<p>Vakama ran on. Now free of pursuit, he no longer bothered to remain invisible. A few small cave Rahi eyed him as he passed by, but none of them posed any threat. He did not even notice them. His mind was fixed on one thought: find the transport.</p>
			<p>Mata Nui must have been smiling upon him, for as he rounded a bend, he spotted the battered hulk of the <i>Lhikan</i>. It was beached in a small cove, resting lopsidedly on some rocks. The reason for that was frighteningly clear. Nokama had been right, one of the spheres was missing.</p>
			<p><i>Where is it?</i> Vakama wondered grief-stricken. <i>Which Matoran has been lost, and how will we ever find him?</i></p>
			<p>A lone silver sphere rested at the bottom of the lake. Monstrous Rahi swam around and above it, yet none dared to approach too closely. It was a dead thing, true, but it did not seem like food. One hungry fish had already shattered its teeth trying to take a chunk out of the object.</p>
			<p>Inside the sphere, the Po-Matoran named Ahkmou lay in unending sleep. His dreams were filled with Morbuzakh vines, four-legged monsters backed by hulking brutes, Vahki squads, and Great Disks. He had no idea where he was or why. His last memory was of sitting in the Coliseum and feeling a great weakness overcome him. Strangely enough, for a Matoran who had tried to betray the Toa Metru and the city, his final conscious thoughts had been: Where are the Toa? Why are they not here to save me?</p>
			<p>Safe in his sphere, Ahkmou slept on, awaiting a being of power that would awaken him someday...</p>
			<p>"Wake up!" Onewa shouted.</p>
			<p>The sound shocked Whenua out of his own thoughts and back to the situation at hand. The explosion had distracted the Kralhi for an instant, long enough for the Toa Metru to make a move. Now Onewa was struggling with a Kralhi's tail, trying to keep it aimed away from his friends.</p>
			<p>"I could use some help here!" said the Toa of Stone.</p>
			<p>Whenua shook off his worries and grabbed hold of the mechanical monstrosity. The Kralhi was straining to turn itself so it could hook the Toa with its tools. Onewa waited until he was sure Whenua had a good grip, then let go.</p>
			<p>"Hold him steady," he said, "and be ready to jump!"</p>
			<p>The Toa of Stone focused his elemental energies at the stone floor beneath the Kralhi's feet. At his command, the rock split apart, opening a crevice into which the Kralhi fell. Whenua barely let go in time, stumbling back from the edge of the gap.</p>
			<p>"Now what?" asked the Toa of Earth. "He will just climb out again."</p>
			<p>"No. I don't think so," Onewa replied.</p>
			<p>The sides of the crevice suddenly slammed shut. Then they slowly opened again, to reveal a sparking, partially mangled machine. Then the front and back walls of the crevice did the same, compacting the Kralhi into a perfectly square block of cables and machinery.</p>
			<p>"There," said the Toa of Stone. "As a mechanized guard, he makes a good brick."</p>
			<p>On the other side of the cave, Nuju was leaping and dodging to stay out of the way of Kralhi energy bubbles. He considered making a break for the tunnel, but thought better of it. The Kralhi would probably just let him go and turn its attention to Nokama and Matau. No, he would have to stand and fight.</p>
			<p>Even as his body twisted and turned to avoid the energy-sapping spheres, Nuju's mind raced. The bubbles were incredibly powerful, generated from energy within the Kralhi. That opened some intriguing possibilities, provided he could keep the Kralhi focused on what was happening now and not what was about to happen.</p>
			<p>"They laugh at you in Ko-Metru, you know," he said. "They call you 'Nuparu's folly'."</p>
			<p>The Kralhi moved in closer, launching energy bubbles at a rapid pace.</p>
			<p>"We needed law enforcers," Nuju continued, ducking and dodging. "Instead, we got dusty, clanking energy vampires. They should have just sent all of you to the Moto-Hub and turned you into Ussal carts."</p>
			<p>There was no way to know if the Kralhi understood the words, but it certainly caught the tone. In the old days, Matoran who spoke this way to a Kralhi would have been sapped of strength almost to the point of nonexistence. Order had to be maintained; insolence had to be punished.</p>
			<p>"Or perhaps some furniture," the Toa of Ice taunted. "We could have broken you down for tables and chairs. Think of the market there would have been for genuine Kralhi footstools and ornament shelves."</p>
			<p>The Kralhi's tail adjusted and locked on to Nuju. The end of it began to crackle as another energy bubble formed. Nuju turned and tried to run as if he were afraid, but, in fact, he was headed for a solid wall. Timing his moves to the split second, the Toa of Ice ran three-quarters of the way up the wall and turned the move into a backward flip. In mid-air, he launched ice blasts from both his crystal spikes.</p>
			<p>His power met the Kralhi energies at their peak. A double-thick coating of solid ice encased the end of the machine's tail just as the energy bubble was about to launch. Now cut off from release, the massive energies of the Kralhi had nowhere to go but back upon itself.</p>
			<p>Nuju hit the floor hard as the Kralhi began to shudder. The Toa used his powers to form a sphere of hard ice around himself. He finished it barely in time, as the feedback sparked a violent explosion that sent Kralhi parts flying everywhere. Nuju's sphere was blown backward and shattered against the stone wall.</p>
			<p>The Toa of Ice lay stunned for a moment amidst shards of his protective sphere and white-hot Kralhi fragments. Then he slowly dragged himself to his feet and looked at the smoking ruin that a moment before had been a powerful robotic guardian.</p>
			<p>"That's the problem with machines," he muttered. "They never think about the future."</p>
			<p>Matau and Nokama had gotten the easy job. A simple wall of wind was enough to keep Mavrah's Rahi pet at bay, while Nokama firmly but gently pinned Mavrah against the wall. She had no wish to harm the Matoran, just talk some sense into him.</p>
			<p>"We are not your enemies," she said, urgency in her voice. "Call off the Kralhi and talk with us. I know what happened, Mavrah, and why you left Metru Nui. But you don't have to stay here. You can come with us."</p>
			<p>The Matoran struggled to break free. "Go with you where?" he said. "If you are telling the truth and Metru Nui is lost, there is nowhere to go. There is nothing beyond the river but death."</p>
			<p>Nokama started to speak, then paused. For all she knew, Mavrah was right. They had only Vakama's vision to tell them that the way to safety was through the Great Barrier. What if he had been wrong? What if there was no haven for the Matoran?</p>
			<p>Mavrah glanced over Nokama's right shoulder. She turned in time to see a Kralhi's forearm swinging at her. Too late to dodge, she rode with the blow as it flung her across the cave. Mavrah rushed to the water's edge.</p>
			<p>"My friends! Hear me!" he shouted to the creatures in the lake. "The time has come to fight for your freedom!"</p>
			<p>Nokama shook her head, not quite believing what she was seeing. The waters were churning as a horde of giant sea Rahi turned and began heading toward the cave. The other Toa saw it too, and were no less stunned.</p>
			<p>"Those Rahi aren't listening to him, are they?" asked Onewa.</p>
			<p>"Of course not," Nuju replied. "No one can command Rahi."</p>
			<p>"Brothers! A little quick-help!"</p>
			<p>They turned to see Matau trapped between two Kralhi. The Toa of Air had summoned a windstorm, but the Kralhi were too heavy to be moved.</p>
			<p>"Which one do you want, right or left?" asked Onewa.</p>
			<p>"It makes no difference," said Nuju. "You choose."</p>
			<p>One of the Kralhi stopped, as if listening to something. The next instant, a jet of flame erupted from its back, traveling rapidly down the length of its body. Before anyone could be quite sure what was happening, the two smoking halves of the machine collapsed.</p>
			<p>Vakama returned to visibility then, lying on his back on the stone floor by Matau's feet. Using the Mask of Concealment to hide his movements, he had slid underneath the Kralhi and put his power of fire to good use.</p>
			<p>Matau glanced down and grinned. "Then it's official, Toa-brother," he said. "You do more lying down than Onewa does all day."</p>
			<p>A second Kralhi emerged from the shadows to join the lone surviving machine. But the Toa had no spare moments to worry about them. Mavrah's army of sea creatures had reached the shore, far faster than anyone had expected. The tentacles of a jellyfish-like creature erupted from the water, wrapped around Nokama's legs, and began pulling her into the lake.</p>
			<p>Nuju reacted instantly, racing to use his ice powers against the creature. Before he could raise his crystal spikes, he was slammed by the powerful tail of a Rahi and flung across the cave.</p>
			<p>Then it was Onewa's turn, reaching out with his Mask of Mind Control to seize control of the creature. Surprisingly, the Rahi fought back. It was left to Whenua to fend off attacks aimed at the Toa of Stone while Onewa remained locked in a mental struggle with the beast. Eventually, the Toa's will won out, as the Rahi released Nokama and dove beneath the water.</p>
			<p>Onewa helped her to her feet. "Are you all right?"</p>
			<p>Nokama nodded. "Yes, thanks to you. Another moment and I would have had to use my blades, and I don't like hurting living creatures."</p>
			<p>"Well, you don't want to know what that thing thinks about," the Toa of Stone said, with a shudder. "You would never go fishing again."</p>
			<p>Nokama looked around at the chaos breaking loose around her. Vakama and Matau were fighting off both the Kralhi and a half dozen flying Rahi rays. Nuju was still waiting for the world to stop spinning. Whenua had his hands full with an undersea insectoid that was larger than him and twice as strong. And all the while, there was Mavrah urging the creatures on.</p>
			<p>"Help Whenua, and get Nuju back on his feet. We need him," Onewa said. "I am going to end this once and for all."</p>
			<p>Despite himself, Mavrah was filled with joy. His friends had come when he called, just like he knew they would. Oh, they hadn't beaten these Toa yet, but they would. Then everything would be right again.</p>
			<p>"Matoran!"</p>
			<p>Mavrah turned. The one called Onewa was approaching, and he looked angry. The Matoran looked around, but there was nowhere to run. Instead, he stood his ground, refusing to show fear to some rock basher from Po-Metru.</p>
			<p>"This ends now," said the Toa. "Call off your oversized aquarium before I show you what stone power can really do."</p>
			<p>The Matoran laughed. "And if you trap me or knock me unconscious, what happens to your friends? Who will keep my Rahi from running wild? No, Onewa, accept it: you cannot harm me."</p>
			<p>Onewa whirled at a familiar sound, one he had hoped never to hear again. "Maybe I can't, Mavrah," he said. "But they can."</p>
			<p>The Matoran looked up. Fifteen Vahki Vorzakh had appeared above the lake, Staffs of Erasure at the ready, pausing while they decided whether to attack the Rahi or the Toa first. It was the sort of choice a Vahki loved.</p>
			<p>A sea creature rammed the base of the rocky ledge on which Onewa and Mavrah stood. The Matoran fell backward into the cave, while Onewa pitched forward and hit the water. It was only after he was under the waves that he remembered that stone does not float...it sinks.</p>
			<h2>8</h2>
			<p>Onewa lay on the bottom of the lake. He had already taken a mouthful of water and his sluggish limbs would not allow him to rise. In his mind, he was back in Po-Metru at his carving table putting the finishing touches on a Kanohi mask. It was slow going. Every time he tapped his chisel into the mask, water gushed forth from it.</p>
			<p>Still, there was no rush. Unlike with most projects, Onewa felt no sense of urgency to complete the work on this mask. Rather, he was strangely calm. Something deep inside of him was screaming that he needed to stop working and get out of there, but the voice was so faint he ignored it.</p>
			<p>After all, what could be so terribly wrong?</p>
			<p>Mavrah sat up, shaking off the effects of hitting the hard stone floor. He opened his eyes, looked around, and wondered if he had lost his mind.</p>
			<p>The sights and sounds of battle surrounded him. Vorzakh were challenging some of the monstrous Rahi. They had succeeded in using their stun staffs on the creatures in an effort to render them mindless. But erasing the minds of creatures that virtually had none to begin with accomplished little. The Rahi simply kept coming, knocking the startled Vorzakh out of the air and then dragging them underwater.</p>
			<p>In the cave, four Toa Metru had formed a square, keeping their backs to each other. Elemental energies flashed as they defended themselves against Kralhi, Rahi, and Vahki. So far, no attack had gotten through to them, but they were so hard-pressed that they could not go on the offensive.</p>
			<p>Mavrah's eyes widened as a Vorzakh veered sharply to the left and smashed into the stone wall. Sparking wildly, it slid into the water and vanished from sight. Nearby, Vakama and Nuju worked together against a Kralhi. While Nuju iced over half the machine, Vakama made the other half glow white-hot. Whatever mechanisms the Kralhi used to compensate for extremes in temperature were rapidly fused or frozen. The machine collapsed in on itself.</p>
			<p>It was all too much. The roar of the Rahi, the crackle of Vahki staffs, the howl of Matau's winds combined to form an overwhelming wall of sound. The Matoran winced as he saw a Vahki slam into a Rahi, stunning it senseless and sending the huge creature plunging into the water. He turned away, only to see the four Toa being driven back by a half dozen Vorzakh.</p>
			<p><i>Four?</i> he wondered. <i>I know Onewa disappeared in the water...but where is Whenua?</i></p>
			<p>The Toa of Earth was wondering the same thing. He had spotted Onewa falling into the water. When his comrade did not immediately surface, Whenua dove in after him. Now he was struggling to make his way through the turbulent water and relying on his Mask of Night Vision to light the way.</p>
			<p>Residents of Onu-Metru and Po-Metru did not normally form close friendships. Onu-Matoran were focused on the past, while Po-Matoran worried only about what work was due to be completed that day and how quickly they could get an akilini game going. But there was a connection between the two metru, whether their populations wanted to admit it or not. Both were bound to the ground, one mining the solid protodermis and the other turning it into the building blocks of the city.</p>
			<p>Earth and stone were brothers, and Whenua knew it. So he never thought twice about risking his life to save Onewa.</p>
			<p>The beam from his Kanohi mask played across a strange shape on the bottom. It was Onewa, lying still, his heartlight dim and barely flickering. A school of Takea sharks was circling above the Toa of Stone, trying to determine if their prey was as defenseless as he seemed.</p>
			<p>Whenua revved his earthshock drills and shot forward. The sharks scattered before him, confused by the vibrations in the water caused by his Toa tools. He knew he had only a few moments before they zeroed in again. A large ray tried to cut him off, but Whenua brushed it aside with a strength born of desperation.</p>
			<p>He grabbed Onewa and pushed himself off the bottom, fighting to make the surface. The sharks turned and followed. Whenua could see the ledge so far above. With the precision of the archivist he used to be, he calculated that he was never going to make it in time.</p>
			<p>The Toa of Earth kicked hard. If he was going to fail, he was going to fail giving it his best. In the back of his mind, he waited to feel the jaws of the sharks closing in on his legs.</p>
			<p>There was a stirring in the water. Whenua glanced to his left to see a huge Tarakava approaching, its powerful forearms already striking out. The creature was obviously heading for the two Toa, but the sharks were not willing to give up their hunt. They turned as one and began snapping at the large Rahi.</p>
			<p>Hope flared anew in Whenua. He forced himself to swim the last few strokes and grabbed the ledge. With the last of his strength, he heaved Onewa out of the water and on to solid ground. He was about to follow when a blow from the Tarakava struck him from behind. By sheer will, Whenua held on, dragging himself painfully back into the cave before collapsing.</p>
			<p>Onewa coughed, spitting out water. He felt like he had been run over by a Kikanalo herd. Weak as he was, though, he found the energy to crawl to Whenua's side. The Toa of Earth was hurting, but still alive. Onewa glanced up to see Mavrah watching them.</p>
			<p>"This is your friend," the Toa of Stone said, exhausted. "He might have been killed. Doesn't that mean anything to you?"</p>
			<p>The Tarakava broke the surface, a shark clinging to one of its arms. Despite its advantages in size and strength, it was obvious the large Rahi would not survive.</p>
			<p>"Or are you no better than them?" Onewa said, gesturing toward the lake.</p>
			<p>"Don't," Mavrah answered. "They are my friends, my companions..."</p>
			<p>Two flying fish closed in on a Vorzakh. It moved out of the way at the last instant and the two Rahi began tearing at each other. "I see," said Onewa, contempt in his voice. "I see how you treat your friends. You put them in danger, you let them be hurt...I think I'd rather have you for an enemy."</p>
			<p>A Vahki spiraled earthward, taking two Rahi with it. Vakama's flames drove a serpentine creature back under the water.</p>
			<p>"Look around you," Onewa continued. "The Rahi you're supposed to be protecting are being wounded, even killed. None of this had to happen. You can stop it."</p>
			<p>A Rahi with a head shaped like an axe blade smashed its way through the cave floor, bowling over the four Toa. A giant crab, dazed by a Vahki stun blast, slipped off its ledge and fell into the water. A school of sharks made short work of it.</p>
			<p>"But why bother?" said Onewa. "I mean, it was never about them anyway, right? It was about you. Dume was going to take your pet project away from you. No more secret passages, no more experiments, just back to the drudgery of working in the Archives. So you stole them and you slipped away, figuring-what? That you would find a way to make them tame, gentle little Ruki fish and return to Metru Nui as a hero of science?"</p>
			<p>The axe-headed beast tossed Matau aside like he was made of seaweed. The Rahi underwater were locked in combat with each other, churning up the lake and sending huge waves crashing into the cave.</p>
			<p>"You don't understand," Mavrah said weakly.</p>
			<p>"I understand that my friends-beings who have risked their lives to save Matoran like you-are in danger," Onewa snapped. "I understand that your 'friends' have caught the scent of battle and are destroying each other. And I understand that this cave is going to be the last place any of us ever see in this lifetime."</p>
			<p>Above their heads, the remaining Vahki were massing for another charge. The axe-headed marine creature had crushed the last Kralhi into a jumbled mess of machine parts.</p>
			<p>Mavrah shook his head. "No, no. This isn't what I wanted. This isn't how it's supposed to be." He ran for the ledge, yelling, "Stop it! Stop!"</p>
			<p>Whenua, still shaken, tried to grab him and missed. "Mavrah, don't!"</p>
			<p>But the Matoran was already at the edge of the water, waving his arms in vain. "Stop fighting! Please stop it!" Even if any of the combatants had been in the mood to listen, his words were drowned out by the sounds of battle and the roar of the waves.</p>
			<p>Whenua got to his feet and staggered toward the Matoran. He had made it only two steps when the largest wave yet smashed into the ledge where Mavrah stood. One moment, the Onu-Matoran was there; the next, he was swept out into the violent waters.</p>
			<p>The Toa of Earth charged forward, only to be grabbed by Onewa. "Whenua, no, it's too late," Onewa said. "The Rahi are out of control. You'll never find him in that. You'll be lost too."</p>
			<p>"But he's my friend," Whenua said, even as he realized that Onewa was right. Nothing could survive in the cauldron the lake had become.</p>
			<p>"I know," Onewa replied. "And so am I."</p>
			<p>Vakama looked up to see Onewa and Whenua running toward him. Nuju and Nokama had just finished driving the Rahi back underwater and sealing the hole in the cave floor with ice.</p>
			<p>"Did you find the transport?" asked Onewa.</p>
			<p>"Yes, it's not far."</p>
			<p>"Then we need to go," said the Toa of Stone, "while we still can."</p>
			<p>"What about the Vahki? Won't they ever-chase?" asked Matau.</p>
			<p>Onewa shook his head. "Stop worrying, Ussal rider, and start running."</p>
			<p>Vakama led the way through the tunnels and back to the transport. While the others got on board, Matau flew ahead to scout. He returned in a matter of moments with a rare piece of good news.</p>
			<p>"All open-clear ahead," he reported. "This tributary bypasses the lake and the Rahi-beasts and feeds back into the river."</p>
			<p>Whenua and Onewa pushed the transport off the rocky shelf and back into the water, then swiftly climbed on board. No one said anything about the missing Matoran sphere. They knew that if they did not get moving, the other five spheres would be lost as well, along with all hope for the sleeping Matoran back in Metru Nui.</p>
			<p>Matau took the controls and they moved quickly down the tributary, each alone with their own thoughts. The sounds of battle faded, then grew louder again as they drew near the river. Then the transport shot through the rapids and landed in another, wider tunnel. Behind them they could see the Rahi still battling Vahki and each other.</p>
			<p>One airborne Vahki spotted the transport. Immediately, all thoughts of the fight were forgotten. Something was fleeing. Vahki were designed to chase anything that fled. It signaled to its companions and a half dozen Vahki took off after the Toa, rapidly gaining ground.</p>
			<p>Vakama glanced over his shoulder and saw the mechanized guardians of Metru Nui closing in. "I'll slow them down," he said to Onewa. "You stop them."</p>
			<p>"Do you know what you're asking?" answered the Toa of Stone. "We'll never be able to come this way again."</p>
			<p>"Then we find another route!" Vakama said, loosing a barrage of fireballs on the oncoming Vahki. "We're going to find a new world, Onewa, and I don't want Vahki to be a part of it."</p>
			<p>The Toa of Fire's elemental powers had not stopped the Vahki, but having to dodge his flames had delayed them and broken their formation. Onewa summoned all his energies and focused them on the roof of the tunnel. The rock was his to command, and by his will, a tunnel that had existed for ages began to collapse. The Vahki dodged the first stones, but the destruction continued, until finally the roof caved in all along the passage.</p>
			<p>The Vahki disappeared beneath an avalanche of rock.</p>
			<p>Matau brought the transport to a stop. All six Toa Metru looked at the wall of stone that now blocked the tunnel. "I feel like that barrier is a sign," said Nokama quietly. "Almost as if the Great Spirit is telling us we will never return to Metru Nui."</p>
			<p>"We'll go back," Vakama assured her. "We must. We still have a destiny to fulfill."</p>
			<p>"Before we can go back, we have to go forward," said Whenua. "That was what Mavrah couldn't see. He became so fixed on what he might be losing, he forgot to look ahead to all the future might have held for him."</p>
			<p>Nuju nodded. "Like so many Onu-Matoran...and too many Ko-Matoran...he tried to hide away from the world."</p>
			<p>A Vahki staff floated to the surface of the water. Vakama fished it out and snapped it in two over his knee.</p>
			<p>"But the world always finds you," the Toa of Fire said, discarding the pieces over the side of the <i>Lhikan</i>.</p>
			<h2>9</h2>
			<p>The transport idled in the water. The last few tight turns had damaged some of the legs and Whenua and Onewa were doing repairs. Nokama sat on the deck, her legs hanging over the side. She had cleaned Matau's "Makuta fish" and was using a sharpened rock to whittle at the bones.</p>
			<p>"What are you making?" Vakama asked, sitting down beside her.</p>
			<p>"A trident, like the Ga-Matoran fishcatchers use," she replied. "It will be a reminder of all we saw and experienced on this journey."</p>
			<p>"I hope we are near the end. The water level in the tunnel is rising. It will be completely flooded soon."</p>
			<p>Nokama paused to examine her work. "Do you think there will be other Toa where we are going, Vakama?"</p>
			<p>The Toa of Fire shrugged. "I don't know. If not, perhaps someday there will be. I'm sure our new home will have its share of dangers and the Matoran will need defenders."</p>
			<p>"And we will be wise old Turaga," Nokama said, smiling. "Good for telling stories, judging akilini matches, and watching Matau try to fly a Gukko bird without falling off. Can't you just see it?"</p>
			<p>She slipped off the transport and into the water. "I think perhaps we should leave this place a remembrance of us, for we won't pass this way again." Using the sharp edge of her hydro blade, she began to carve patterns in the rock wall.</p>
			<p>When she was done, she turned to Vakama. "Not as good as what Onewa would do, but...what do you think?"</p>
			<p>The Toa of Fire looked at the newly carved image of the six Toa Metru and smiled. "You should have been a Po-Matoran," he said. "It's a shame no one else will ever see this."</p>
			<p>"It's amazing! Amazing!"</p>
			<p>The two Toa turned to see Matau flying in excited circles above the ship.</p>
			<p>"I found the new world-home! It's...it's...you have to come see!" the Toa of Air shouted.</p>
			<p>"Can the transport get us there?" Vakama asked Onewa.</p>
			<p>"If I say yes, will he stop yelling?"</p>
			<p>"Probably."</p>
			<p>"Then yes," said the Toa of Stone.</p>
			<p>Long before they emerged from the tunnel, they were shielding their eyes from the light. Whenua, in particular, had to squint. "Mata Nui, if this place is so bright, how will we see anything?" he said.</p>
			<p>Then suddenly they were out on the open sea again, with a whole new universe around them. Light, blazing like the fires of the Great Furnace, spilled down from a bright, yellow orb in the sky. The waters stretched out to the horizon, with no great stone barrier to enclose them. Above their heads, seabirds wheeled and screeched what might have been a welcome or a warning.</p>
			<p>"By the Great Spirit...it's incredible," whispered Nokama. "Such beauty."</p>
			<p>She reached down and caught some water in her cupped hand. Cautiously, she brought it to her mouth and took a taste. She immediately spat it back out. "This is <i>not</i> water," she said. "Not like what we knew on Metru Nui."</p>
			<p>"You had best get used to surprises, Nokama," said Nuju. "I think this world is filled with them."</p>
			<p>Matau turned the transport and for the first time, they saw the vast island that would be their new home. It was many times the size of Metru Nui, with mountains far higher than those of Po-Metru and great expanses covered with vegetation. At first, Vakama looked at all the plant life and wondered if perhaps this place was the domain of the Morbuzakh. Then he saw that the glowing things here were lush and green, not withered and blackened like the vines that had menaced his city.</p>
			<p>Nothing stirred on the beach. Beyond the birds overhead, there seemed to be no animal life on the island. The white sands looked as if no one had ever walked upon them before. All six Toa gazed upon the island with a mixture of awe, hope, and uncertainty.</p>
			<p>"Where is the power plant?" asked Whenua. "Where are the chutes? The moto-hub? Even an assemblers' village would look good now."</p>
			<p>"This is a wild place," said Vakama. "We are going to have to build our own lives here, for ourselves and the Matoran, without the comforts of Metru Nui."</p>
			<p>"Right," said Onewa, his voice heavy with sarcasm. "And then Matau will go live in a tree."</p>
			<p>"The carver does have a point," said Nuju. "It is a wondrous place, but how can we expect the Matoran to live here? Can we build a civilization in this wilderness?"</p>
			<p>"We'll find a way," said Vakama, with more confidence than Nokama could ever recall hearing in his voice. "That is why the Great Spirit Mata Nui guided us here and kept us safe on our journey. This will be our home and our haven."</p>
			<p>"Then why do I feel like we have left a paradise behind, in favor of a very, very strange place?" asked Whenua. Then his attention was drawn to the seabirds, which looked like nothing he had ever seen before. "What do you think those are? We never had anything like that in the Archives. How do they glide in the air like that?"</p>
			<p>"Well, Whenua is ready for our new land, I see," said Nokama. "I think the time has come, brothers."</p>
			<p>Matau piloted the transport to shore. Nokama could not stop looking all around her, thinking what a wonderful spot this would make for a Ga-Matoran village. <i>Someday,</i> she thought, hopefully. <i>Someday I will bring them all here.</i></p>
			<p>Then, one by one, the Toa Metru stepped out onto the sands of the island that would be their home for many, many years to come.</p>
			<h2>Epilogue</h2>
			<p>"And so we found the island of Mata Nui, though it was not so called then," Turaga Nokama finished. "The Great Spirit had watched over us and helped us to find a place where the Matoran could live in peace once more."</p>
			<p>"Then the carving I found in the underwater tunnel during my search for the Kanohi Nuva masks...the one of the six mysterious Toa-?" Gali Nuva began.</p>
			<p>"That was the carving I made, long ago," said Nokama. "I led you there because I wanted you to find it, Gali. I wanted you to see you are not alone. You are part of a great tradition. There were heroes before you came, Toa of Water, and others will rise after your destiny is fulfilled."</p>
			<p>Tahu Nuva spoke then, clearly uncomfortable about what he had to say. "I thank you for sharing your tale, Turaga. But my questions are still unanswered. You arrived on Mata Nui with only five Matoran, leaving so many behind in the depths of the city. How, then, did so many come to live here? Did they awaken and escape the city?"</p>
			<p>Turaga Nuju clicked and whistled angrily at the Toa of Fire. Matoro looked at Turaga Nokama. "Do I have to translate that?" he asked. "I mean...he's a Toa, and when he gets angry, things burn."</p>
			<p>"I am guessing Toa Tahu understands the spirit, if not the meaning, of Nuju's comments," Nokama replied. "I suppose all this is our own fault-first, for keeping secrets from you, and then for believing we could share some of our past while keeping other doors shut to you."</p>
			<p>She turned to Nuju. "We should have remembered, my friend, that Toa cannot stand a closed door."</p>
			<p>"Then there is more to the tale," said Tahu Nuva. "Why won't you reveal it?"</p>
			<p>"Because it is not her tale to tell."</p>
			<p>All present turned to see Turaga Vakama approaching. His expression was grim. Feeling the power and wisdom that radiated from him, it was hard to believe he had ever been an uncertain Matoran forced into a hero's role.</p>
			<p>"Tell me, Toa of Fire, of what are you most afraid?" the Turaga asked.</p>
			<p>Tahu Nuva thought back on all the enemies he had faced: Makuta, the Bohrok, the Bahrag, the Bohrok-Kal, the Rahi, the Rahkshi. He remembered all the battles, lost and won, all the mysteries solved, all the dangers he had faced and overcome. But no easy answer to Vakama's question came to mind.</p>
			<p>"If you fear nothing at all," said the Turaga, "then you are a fool and you will not understand my tale. It would be a waste of time to tell it."</p>
			<p>In times past, Tahu would have reacted to such words with rage. But he had learned much about himself during the battle with Makuta and the Rahkshi. When he spoke, it was firmly and quietly. "Ignorance, Turaga."</p>
			<p>"Explain."</p>
			<p>"I worry...I am afraid...that one day I might lead my friends into danger-even cost them their lives-because I did not know all that I should have known."</p>
			<p>Vakama smiled. "Then you are not a fool, Tahu. You are a leader, for that is what every leader dreads. I hope it is a nightmare you will never see come true."</p>
			<p>At Vakama's words, Nokama and Nuju had turned away. There had been something in the tone of them that clutched at Gali's heart. For a moment, she wished that she could block all sound and not have to listen to the stories to come.</p>
			<p>"You have heard tales of betrayal and hope," said Vakama. "Of power lost and power gained. From my lips, you have learned of the paradise that was the city of Metru Nui. Through my stories, you have faced Makuta once more, when his darkness was newly born."</p>
			<p>The Turaga shook his head sadly. "But you know nothing of what the city became...nothing of true shadow...and nothing of the terrible choices a hero must make. Choices that must haunt his every waking hour for centuries."</p>
			<p>Vakama looked up. In his eyes, Tahu could see some of the fire that had once been there when he was a Toa Metru, long ago.</p>
			<p>"So this is what I will do for you, Tahu Nuva," the Turaga said. "I will tell you another tale, you and all of your fellow heroes of Mata Nui. I will spare no detail. And when I am done, you will have a choice. If you wish me to be silent, I will say no more and you can be content with what you know."</p>
			<p>Vakama's tone grew as dark as Makuta's lair. "Or bid me speak on, Toa of Fire, and I will reveal to you the shapes in the shadows, and the true meaning of fear."</p>
			<p>The Turaga turned and walked away, leaving Tahu, Gali and Kopaka to ponder the meaning of his words.</p>
