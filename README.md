# OpenChronicle
In the time before time (2001), Lego launched an extremely popular toy line named "BIONICLE", short for "Biological Chronicle". The line would continue until 2010. Books, comics, video games, and movies were made to tie in to the line, which provided a rich story with the heroic Toa at the center. For more information on BIONICLE, visit [the BIONICLE fan wiki](http://biosector01.com) or [the BioMedia Project](http://biomediaproject.com/bmp/).

This project aims to streamline and improve the story of BIONICLE. A release will be created as each section of the roadmap below is considered completed.

## Roadmap

- Novels are the most comprehensive and most malleable medium used to tell the original BIONICLE story. Full transcripts of these will be created as a starting point.

- The novels were originally sold separately. As such, they had to be accessible to readers without knowledge of previous installments. This is not the case here, so extraneous exposition will be removed. The worse word choices, such as referring to the Guurahk as "Disintegrator-Rahkshi", will be revised as well.

- The diverse media used to tell this story hinders its accessibility. Important story points can easily be missed if you don't actively look for them. For example, *Beware the Bohrok* makes no mention of [Boxors](http://biosector01.com/wiki/index.php/Boxor). Content from other media will be adapted into text and added.

- The gender of characters was decided from the beginning to skew disproportionately male as Lego focused their marketing towards young boys. While this likely made BIONICLE what it is today by keeping sales up, it is ultimately harmful to the story, not to mention sexist. Characters will be rewritten as other genders for balance. The previous convention that all Matoran of a certain element shared a gender is invalid.

- BIONICLE's story contains some questionable design decisions, such as the fact that Vakama was the leader of the Toa Metru. By this point, the project will have grown to restructuring story arcs as contributors see fit.
