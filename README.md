# OpenChronicle
In the time before time (2001), Lego launched an extremely popular toy line named "BIONICLE", short for "Biological Chronicle". The line would continue until 2010. Books, comics, video games, and movies were made to tie in to the line, which provided a rich story with the heroic Toa at the center.
For more information on BIONICLE, visit [the BIONICLE fan wiki](http://biosector01.com) or [the BioMedia Project](http://biomediaproject.com/bmp/).

This project aims to streamline and improve the story of BIONICLE, with these goals in mind:

- Create full transcripts of all BIONICLE novels

- Remove extraneous exposition which was originally required to bring readers up to speed if they started reading partway through the series.

- Revise bad word choices, such as referring to the Panrahk as "Fragmenter-Rahkshi".

- Adapt to text and add story told through non-book media, for example adding the [Boxors](http://biosector01.com/wiki/index.php/Boxor) to *Beware the Bohrok*.

- Rewrite some characters as the other gender. Original BIONICLE canon suffered from a lack of female characters.

- Correct bad design decisions originally necessary for marketing purposes.
