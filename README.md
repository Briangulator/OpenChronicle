# The Open Chronicle
In the time before time (2001), Lego launched an extremely popular toy line named "BIONICLE", short for "Biological Chronicle". The line would continue until 2010. Books, comics, video games, and movies were made to tie in to the line, which provided a rich story with the heroic Toa at the center.

The diverse media used to tell the Bionicle hinders its accessibility. Important story points can easily be missed if you don't actively look for them. For example, *Beware the Bohrok* makes no mention of [Boxors](http://biosector01.com/wiki/index.php/Boxor).

This project aims to create a single document containing all important story elements in Bionicle. A full transcription of every novel is currently being written as a starting point. When the transcription is finished, the books will be merged together and with story portions told through other media.

In the meantime, read up at [the Bionicle fan wiki](http://biosector01.com) or [the BioMedia Project](http://biomediaproject.com/bmp/).
