			<h1>BIONICLE: The Legend Reborn</h1>

			<h2>Prologue</h2>
			<p>	Through the dark void of space, a golden mask flew...</p>
			<p>	Seen from far away, it might have looked like a shooting star. Had someone been close enough to see what it really was, they might have wondered how such an object could have ended up among the stars. The answer would take years to tell, if one were to explore every mystery of it. But this is all the observer would truly need to know:</p>
			<p>	Once, there was a great ruler named Mata Nui. He was incredibly powerful-his body was made of metal and stood 40 million feet high. He traveled through space, exploring new worlds. His creators, known as the Great Beings, intended for him to fulfill a vital mission. But first, they wished him to learn as much as he could about the universe around him.</p>
			<p>	Unfortunately, while he focused on that universe, he ignored another one-one that existed inside his metal shell. Millions of beings lived inside of Mata Nui, and their labors gave him power. In return, he was to protect them from harm. But he grew so fascinated with the wonders of other worlds that he paid little attention to those who depended upon him.</p>
			<p>	As so often happens, neglect allows evil to breed. A conspiracy grew in Mata Nui's inner universe. Those who hungered for power struck at him, casting him into a deep sleep that lasted for a millennium. When at last he woke again, it was to find that his greatest enemy had stolen his body. Mata Nui's mind and spirit were trapped in the golden Mask of Life and hurled into space.</p>
			<p>	Now he flew through the void, out of control, knowing that his people were under the rule of a dark and unforgiving master. He had failed them. By not being vigilant, by not being wise, he had allowed himself to be forced from his body and exiled. In this new form, he had no hope of defeating his enemy.</p>
			<p>	Any other being would have surrendered to his fate. But Mata Nui knew he had a destiny to fulfill. Somehow, he vowed, he would find a way to return and free his people. It might take a thousand years, but only death would stop him from trying.</p>
			<p>	The masks' direction shifted now, as the gravitational pull of a planet took hold. It sped up, diving toward the surface, its outer skin heating up as it entered the atmosphere. The next few moments would tell the tale. Would the mask survive the heat and the impact of a crash-landing, or would it shatter, taking Mata Nui's spirit with it to destruction? Would his quest begin on the world so far below, or would it end there?</p>
			<p>	Within the golden mask, Mata Nui could do nothing now but hope...</p>
			<h2>One</h2>
			<p>	A swarm of scarabax beetles scurried across a sand dune, in search of their evening meal. On most evenings, this hunt was uneventful. The beetles would feed and then return to their underground tunnels. But this night was destined to be different.</p>
			<p>	One beetle lifted its eyes from the sand and saw something strange. It began clicking its pincers to alert its comrades. Other scarabax joined in, watching as a point of light streaked through the night sky and became a large fireball.</p>
			<p>	The scarabax scattered. The falling object smashed into the ground and skidded across the sands, carving out a trench as it traveled. The intense heat fused the sand to glass. Finally, it came to a halt on the edge of a dune. Smoke drifted from its metallic surface.</p>
			<p>	Slowly, the scarabax emerged from hiding. They could feel the heat coming from the object. The swarm moved closer. They didn't realize that it was a metal mask. Still, there was something about it which compelled them to draw near...</p>
			<p>	Without warning, the mask rose into the air. The beetles jumped back in surprise as the sand beneath it swirled like a miniature cyclone. Now the mask hovered more than seven feet in the air, surrounded by a contained sandstorm. After a few moments, the sands began to take on a recognizable shape. Two arms, two legs, and a torso formed from the whirling grains, then turned solid.</p>
			<p>	The storm ended. There now stood a being wearing a mask. His armor was white and gold, and his body lean and strong. He brought his hands to his mask, gently, as if not certain it was real. Then he looked down at his new body.</p>
			<p>	The newcomer took a step, and his knees buckled. Catching himself, he took a deep breath before trying again. As he lifted and extended his leg, he heard a clicking sound.</p>
			<p>	Looking down, the strange being saw a scarabax beetle right where his foot was about to land. He pulled back, saying, "Sorry, little one."</p>
			<p>	The beetle moved back, cowering in fear.</p>
			<p>	"Easy," said the being. "I will not hurt you."</p>
			<p>	Responding to the stranger's gentle tone, the beetle lowered its pincers and looked up, cocking its head to one side.</p>
			<p>	"My name is Mata Nui," said the stranger. "You may have noticed I am not steady on my feet yet."</p>
			<p>	Mata Nui knelt down, extending his hand to the scarabax. The beetle sprang into his palm and scampered up his arm, clicking furiously.</p>
			<p>	"I have the feeling you're trying to tell me something," said Mata Nui. The beetle was on his shoulder now, close to his mask.</p>
			<p>	"Ah, it's the mask you're interested in."</p>
			<p>	The beetle brushed its pincer against Mata Nui's mask, making it glow brightly. For a moment, it seemed like the mask and scarabax were one. Then the glow faded, and Mata Nui could see that the insect had been transformed. Where once there had been a small beetle, there was now a full-sized shield with the symbol of a single eye in its center.</p>
			<p>	"Magnificent..." whispered Mata Nui in wonder.</p>
			<p>	Then the eye on the shield <i>blinked</i>.</p>
			<p>	Mata Nui jumped back, startled.</p>
