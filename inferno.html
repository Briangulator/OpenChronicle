			<h1>BIONICLE Legends #5: Inferno</h1>
			<h3>Greg Farshtey</h3>
			<h2>Introduction</h2>
			<p><b>100,000+ Years Ago</b></p>
			<p>&#xA;	Two cloaked figures walked silently through a vast underground chamber. They had traveled far to reach this spot, starting from a place whose forges burned hotter than the stars themselves. They had traversed the domains of Artakha and Karzahni, crossed vast wastelands that would someday teem with life, until finally they reached their intended destination. All along the way they were watchful, for the path was dangerous and the cargo they carried priceless.</p>
			<p>	Their journey had brought them to the center of a large continent. All around them, the biomechanical beings beings they had named Matoran were hard at work at an assortment of tasks. They took no notice of the newcomers, for that is how the two travelers wished it.</p>
			<p>	"Is this wise?" one asked the other.</p>
			<p>	"Wise, and something even rarer than that," came the answer. "It is practical."</p>
			<p>	The smaller of the two figures raised his weapon and blasted a hole in the ground. Again, the Matoran took no notice. He fired again, creating the beginnings of a tunnel in the earth. As he did so, his partner stood to the side, holding the golden shell in which their treasure resided.</p>
			<p>	The work of blasting and tunneling went on for some hours, with hours more spent carving a great staircase that traveled the length of the tunnel. At the bottom of the stairs, the grim figure increased the power of his weapon and blasted a huge chamber into existence.</p>
			<p>	"Is this far enough down?" he asked.</p>
			<p>	The second figure nodded. "We want it to take them time to reach the bottom, but not all of their days."</p>
			<p>	Both figures shed their cloaks. The new chamber was ringed by canals of molten lava and the heat was stifling. The golden shell was placed on the ground, gently, as the two set to work building a pedestal for it out of a piece of stone. When they were done, the taller figure opened the shell slowly and hesitantly as if its contents might explode.</p>
			<p>	"Be careful!" said the other. "You remember what happened the last time someone touched it."</p>
			<p>	"I do indeed. It was a useful lesson in the need to respect objects of power. Now keep quiet a moment, or we will get a second lesson courtesy of our creation."</p>
			<p>	Unlimbering special tools, the figure pried apart the shell to reveal a Kanohi mask inside. On the surface, it seemed not so very much different from dozens of other Masks of Power. But where other masks might be useful tools or powerful weapons, this one had the power to give life to a universe...or to obliterate it.</p>
			<p>	Steeling himself for what was to come next, he grasped the mask with the ends of the two tools. Energy flowed up the shafts and into the figure, sending intense pain through his form. But he did not scream. He would not, he decided, give something he had made the satisfaction of knowing it had hurt him.</p>
			<p>	Ignoring the agony, he used the tools to lift the mask into the air and deposit it on the pedestal. Then he quickly withdrew his hold of the object. The mask rested in its appointed place now, where it was destined to remain until needed.</p>
			<p>	"It's not enough," said the smaller figure. "We can bury it deep, even provide Umbra as a protector for it. But can we be sure it is safe here?"</p>
			<p>	"We will do what we must," his partner replied. "Mata Nui will one day face challenges we cannot even imagine, in places we can only dream of. If one of those challenges proves to be too great even for his power, this Mask of Life may be all that can save him."</p>
			<p>	"All the more reason to guard-"</p>
			<p>	"The mask will make its own guardians, as it needs them. You know that. Be assured, the Mask of Life will never leave this chamber until the destined time."</p>
			<p>	"Then it's time for us to leave," said the smaller figure, putting his weapon away. "I prefer not to be so close to it."</p>
			<p>	"Afraid of something you made yourself?"</p>
			<p>	"I've seen what the mask can do...how far it will go to protect itself. I am still not convinced that we can prevent anyone from taking it before its time-but I pity anyone who tries."</p>
			<p>	With a final look at the Mask of Life, the two figures departed the chamber and started the long climb back to the surface. This would be their last visit to the continent, and though their passage went unnoticed, they and their kind were not unknown. In centuries to come, Matoran would speak in wonder of the Great Beings who brought Mata Nui into existence and charged him to watch over the universe.</p>
			<p>	And the Mask of Life? It would be taken from its chamber only once in 100 millennia. When it was seen what the mask could do, it was swiftly returned with a mixture of gratitude and horror. There it remained, until one demented, doomed being dared to attempt its theft-and paid for it. Now mask and mad being lurk down below, waiting for the day someone else will attempt to summon the energies of the Mask of Life.</p>
			<p>	Waiting until now...</p>
			<h2>One</h2>
			<p>	The crimson-armored Piraka named Hakann was trying hard to think. When in a dangerous situation, he knew, it was important to clearly and logically consider events and plan your next steps. And it would have been much easier to do if someone weren't screaming.</p>
			<p>	It took a few moments for Hakann to realize the screams were coming from his own mouth.</p>
			<p>	<i>Stop it!</i> Hakann yelled at himself. <i>Stop behaving like some pathetic Matoran, and act like the murderous, treacherous Piraka that you are!</i></p>
			<p>	What had happened? How had he gone from being in control to being a total, horror-stricken wreck, sitting on a staircase with his armor melting off him?</p>
			<p>	He made a mental leap to grab a shred of reality still floating around in his brain. Yes, now he remembered. The six Piraka had discovered the hidden entrance to a huge stone stairway. The stairs, they had been told, led down to a Chamber of Life where the powerful Kanohi Ignika was hidden. The Ignika, or Mask of Life, was the prize they had come to Voya Nui to find and steal.</p>
			<p>	There were complications, of course. After demolishing a team of Toa Nuva, the Piraka had encountered a second team of Toa on the island. These Toa Inika wielded lightning along with their other powers and actually proved to be a challenge. But the Piraka had still managed to get a head start down the staircase.</p>
			<p>	Hakann was in the lead. He knew it was potentially fatal to turn his back on his partners. But the one who made it to the chamber first would get his claws on the mask first. He decided that was worth the risk.</p>
			<p>	He had made his way down a few dozen stairs, navigating by the glow of lightstones embedded in the walls, when he came to a fork in the staircase. The left passage was blocked with stone, but the right was open, so he went right. Suddenly, something flew at him from out of the darkness, too fast for him to dodge. As it struck him, he realized it looked like a zamor sphere. Had one of the other Piraka somehow gotten ahead of him to stage an ambush?</p>
			<p>	No, that wasn't it, he realized. Zamor spheres didn't make you feel like this. Hakann felt like the world was rushing by him and he was standing still. He felt dizzy and sick and warm...then searingly hot...as if the flame power he commanded had been unleashed inside him. He staggered backward, already seeing his armor starting to soften and run like rock in a lava pool. The pain was agonizing. Some little voice in his head was saying that this made no sense, because his organic tissue wasn't near enough to his armor to be affected. The rest of him was too busy yelling in shock and pain.</p>
			<p>	Now something was lumbering up the stairs toward him. It was impossibly big and broad and the light glinted off its golden head and spine.</p>
			<p>	<i>Golden spine?...That would mean...no, that's just a myth!</i></p>
			<p>	But it was no fable approaching, teeth bared in a savage smile, claws ready to rip and tear. It was the nightmare of every member of Hakann's species-a legendary denizen of the darkness who lived to destroy. It was a creature of myth that had never existed...but it lived here and now, and Hakann couldn't help but scream its name.</p>
			<p>	"Irnakk!"</p>
			<p>	The Piraka turned and fled then, melted armor dripping on the stairs as he ran. He stumbled before he reached the top of the stairs. He could hear Irnakk coming up behind him. Desperate, Hakann tried to huddle in a corner. <i>Maybe it won't see me,</i> he reasoned, as he shut his eyes tight. <i>Maybe...maybe it will be content just to kill the others.</i></p>
			<p>	And the sound of footsteps came closer, and closer, and closer...</p>
			<p>&#xA;"What happened to him?" asked Thok, looking down at the terrified Hakann. "Is this some trick?"</p>
			<p>	"Hakann!" Zaktan snapped. "Stop screaming and tell us what happened!"</p>
			<p>	Reidak tapped Zaktan on the shoulder and pointed down the stairs. "I think that happened."</p>
			<p>	The monstrous being called Irnakk appeared. Its laugh tore at the Piraka's sanity.</p>
			<p>	"No..." breathed Avak.</p>
			<p>	"Impossible," said Zaktan.</p>
			<p>	Irnakk bellowed. The sound stabbed at the Piraka's minds like a sword of fire. If they didn't believe in it before, they had to accept the reality of this monster now.</p>
			<p>	"How can this be?" asked Thok, preparing for combat even as raw fear clutched at his heart. "Everyone knows there's no such thing as Irnakk!"</p>
			<p>	"Tell it that," snarled Avak. "Maybe you can get it to agree it doesn't exist."</p>
			<p>	The brown-armored Piraka reached out with his power to create a prison around the advancing Irnakk. Before it could take shape, one of the multiple zamor spheres mounted on Irnakk's shoulders took flight. It struck Avak dead center. Just that quickly, Avak found he could not move or speak. He was trapped, and his own body was his prison cell.</p>
			<p>	"No such thing, says you?" Irnakk growled in a voice like bones cracking. "As real as pain and death, says I."</p>
			<p>	Thok thought fast. What happened in the myths? How was Irnakk defeated? Then he realized that all the tales told by his species ended the same way-Irnakk slaughters everyone in sight and leaves only when there is no one left to demolish.</p>
			<p>	<i>All right, if I can't stop him, I'll slow him down,</i> the white-armored Piraka decided. He used his power on the tunnel walls, aiming to bring them to life and crush Irnakk between them.</p>
			<p>	Another zamor sphere fired from Irnakk's body. When it struck, Thok could feel his power being blocked and reversed. The next moment, his own armor came to life and began to squeeze. He felt the breath being forced out of his lungs. Thok gasped, but couldn't get any air. He was being crushed by his own power and couldn't stop it.</p>
			<p>	"Back to the surface!" Zaktan yelled. "Let it have these three!"</p>
			<p>	Reidak and Vezok were already on the run, deserting their leader and their partners. Two more zamor spheres caught them in the back. Instantly, they turned and started battling each other. Vezok pummeled Reidak with a rock until the black-armored Piraka went down. But Reidak's power to adapt would not let him stay defeated for long. He was back on his feet, slamming Vezok into the walls repeatedly until his enemy fell. Reidak smiled.</p>
			<p>	Then the smile disappeared. Battered and twisted, Vezok rose again. He had absorbed Reidak's power to adapt after defeats and to fight anew. Reidak charged back into battle, already knowing this fight could never end.</p>
			<p>	Zaktan stopped in mid-flight. He could transform himself into a swarm of protodites and slip past the battling Vezok and Reidak, but now he knew there was no point. There would be no escape from Irnakk...not this way.</p>
			<p>	The leader of the Piraka turned to face the only thing he feared. Irnakk towered over him, eyes gleaming with satisfaction. "What are you?" asked Zaktan. "How did you escape from the world of legend to this desolate place?"</p>
			<p>	Irnakk's answer was a burst of crimson light from his eyes that enveloped Zaktan. The power cascaded over the Piraka's form, transforming him from physical matter to a being of pure thought. He no longer had any substance, but was just a fleeting wisp, like a half-remembered idea. An instant later, he felt a sensation of movement and he was suddenly somewhere else.</p>
			<p>	Picture the most complicated maze in existence, where slimy walls throbbed with life. Imagine a place that thundered with the sounds of madness, so loud the noise threatened to shatter the skull. Try to conceive of a place where the "air" was so heavy and thick that taking a step felt like walking underwater. Add all of this together and an image might form that was one-tenth of what Zaktan experienced in his new home.</p>
			<p>	<i>I'm in Irnakk's mind,</i> the Piraka realized with horror. <i>It turned me into a thought and...drew me into its mind.</i></p>
			<p>	An explosion rocked the walls, sending Zaktan flying. He felt like his head would burst from the sound. His lungs burned. At first, he thought perhaps someone had attacked Irnakk. Then the truth came to him-the convulsion in Irnakk's mind had not been the result of an impact. That had been Irnakk conceiving an idea.</p>
