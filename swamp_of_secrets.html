			<h1>BIONICLE Legends #10: Swamp of Secrets</h1>
			<h3>Greg Farshtey</h3>
			<h2>Prologue</h2>
			<p>	Takanuva, Toa of Light, walked along the shoreline of the city of Metru Nui, his keen eyes scanning the waters. He did this every day, waiting for some sign of the Toa Nuva's return.</p>
			<p>	His time as sole guardian of the city was over. The Toa Mahri had returned, minus one of their number, to help secure Metru Nui. But the Toa Nuva were still missing, and no one knew where they were. He had petitioned Turaga Dume for permission to go searching for them. The Turaga had promised to consider it, but Takanuva was tired of waiting.</p>
			<p>	<i>I sat here and did nothing while the Toa Nuva almost died on the island of Voya Nui,</i> he thought. <i>I wasn't there when Jaller and his team risked their lives to save the Great Spirit Mata Nui. Maybe Toa Matoro wouldn't have died if I had been there. Not again-never again!</i></p>
			<p>	For just a moment, he felt something dark and foul skitter through the back of his mind. It was not the first time he had experienced this, and at first, the experience had unnerved him. It was Turaga Onewa who told him that what he was feeling was some other mind trying to intrude on his. Instead of pulling away, Takanuva was supposed to push back to try and find the source.</p>
			<p>	The Toa of Light steeled himself and thrust with all his mental energy. Suddenly, he saw a picture in his mind. It was only there for an instant, but long enough for him to see that his attacker was in the Metru Nui Archives. Along with the picture came two words, heard as clearly as if someone had spoken them out loud.</p>
			<p>	<i>Dark Hunter.</i></p>
			<p>	Takanuva broke into a run, heading for the Onu-Metru district and the entrance to the Archives. It all made sense now. The band of thieves and killers called Dark Hunters had coveted Metru Nui for thousands of years. They had slipped one of their number into the city, no doubt to stage a sneak attack in preparation for a full-scale invasion.</p>
			<p>	<i>Good plan,</i> thought Takanuva. <i>Too bad it's about to turn into such a disaster for them.</i></p>
			<p>	He ran, dashing past Matoran hard at work rebuilding the city, leaping over obstacles, totally focused on his goal. Later, he would realize that if he had been paying more attention to his surroundings, he might have noticed the slime-covered creature that was slithering toward him. He might have saved himself.</p>
			<p>	Takanuva had almost reached his destination when it struck. The shadow leech leapt at him, attaching itself to his armor with an unbreakable hold. It was hungry, and light was its preferred meal. In the Toa of Light, it had a feast waiting to be eaten.</p>
			<p>	He screamed as the creature began to drain the light that was his essence. For a normal being, it would have been painful, but for someone who was as bonded to light as Takanuva, it was sheer agony. As the light left him, it was replaced by darkness. Instinctively, he knew that if this creature wasn't stopped, he would be a Toa of Shadow when it was done-if he was still alive at all.</p>
			<p>	Takanuva stumbled and fell. The pain was getting worse. If he blacked out, it would be all over. He had to do something now.</p>
			<p>	The leech was clinging to his chest armor, gorging itself on light. The armor had already turned from gold to gray, signaling how close Takanuva was to being lost to darkness. With great effort, he raised his arm and pointed his hand directly at the leech. Then a thin, intense beam of light shot from Takanuva's palm, striking the creature.</p>
			<p>	At first, it seemed like a terrible mistake. Hitting a creature who fed on light with more light looked to only make it stronger. But with the light came heat-blistering heat. Smoke rose from the shadow leech as it began to burn. When the heat became unbearable, the creature tore itself loose and tried to squirm away. The Toa increased the power of the beam until the shadow leech was nothing but smoke and ashes.</p>
			<p>	Then Takanuva collapsed, unconscious. His last thought was whether he would still be a Toa of Light when he awakened, or if it was already too late.</p>
			<p>&#xA;When he could see again, Takanuva looked around in surprise. He would have expected to be in Turaga Dume's chambers in the Coliseum or even in some Matoran shelter in Onu-Metru. Instead, he was in a darkened room that stank of rot. <i>Am I dead then?</i> he wondered. <i>Just waiting for some Po-Matoran to carve my memorial stone?</i></p>
			<p>	"No, you are very much alive."</p>
			<p>	A figure moved toward Takanuva in the dim light. For reasons he couldn't name, the Toa's first thought was that it was Makuta, come for revenge. But a minor use of his power illuminated the room and revealed the being drawing closer. She was not Makuta, but she was indescribably ancient and disturbingly frail in appearance. Her mask and armor were pitted and scarred from a thousand battles. She looked like a Toa, but her armor and mask design didn't resemble anything Takanuva had ever seen before.</p>
			<p>	The light revealed another figure as well. This one was also a Toa, though not someone Takanuva recognized. His Mask of Power matched the description of a Suletu, or Mask of Telepathy.</p>
			<p>	"It is good to see you are still alive," the female said, her voice so soft it could barely be heard. "When Toa Krakua here found you, we thought...well, we did not bring you to a place of the dead on a whim."</p>
			<p>	Takanuva sat up painfully and looked around. He knew what this place was now. He had heard Turaga Whenua describe it. If a Rahi beast in the Archives died, either by accident or in an escape attempt, its body would be brought to this chamber for study. Fortunately, there were no carcasses in the room right now, but it was still a very unpleasant spot to visit.</p>
			<p>	"Who are you? What's going on?" demanded the Toa of Light.</p>
			<p>	"I am Helryx, leader of the Order of Mata Nui," came the reply.</p>
			<p>	"I never heard of it...or you."</p>
			<p>	"If you had, we would have another worry," said Helryx. "As for what is going on, the answer is...hopefully not more than your mind is able to comprehend."</p>
			<p>	"And that Toa?" asked Takanuva. "Is he a member of your little group?"</p>
			<p>	Helryx shook her head. "Not a member, no. But we needed a courier to bring messages between ourselves and the likes of you, one who could do so without revealing the existence of our Order. So we arranged for a Matoran of Sonics named Krakua to achieve his destiny and become a Toa."</p>
			<p>	"I must have hit my head when I fell," muttered Takanuva. "Hit it really hard."</p>
			<p>	Helryx's expression darkened. She held out her hand toward the Toa of Light. Instantly, he found himself pinned to the wall by spikes made of water.</p>
			<p>	"Fool!" she snapped. "Even now, the Toa Nuva fight for their lives, and only you can help them. But to do so, you must be armed with knowledge...the kind only we can provide. So you <i>will</i> listen, and you <i>will</i> hear!"</p>
			<p>	It was all a little too much for Takanuva. "Why me? After that attack, I don't even know how much power I have left."</p>
			<p>	"More than you know," Helryx answered. "In over 100,000 years, the Order has revealed its existence to very few, and then only in a time of great need. This is such a time-and we have need of a unique Toa, one who walks the world of both light and shadow."</p>
			<p>	"But I'm not-"</p>
			<p>	"Silence! The time has come to begin."</p>
			<p>	Helryx gestured to Toa Krakua, who stepped forward. In his hand, he held a small creature. It looked like a cross between the krana who lived inside the Bohrok swarms and the worm-like kraata who dwelled inside Rahkshi armor. The combination was far from pretty.</p>
			<p>	"Do not fear," said Helryx. "There is much you need to learn and much you need to see. Our little pet is here to provide...visual aid."</p>
			<p>	With that, Krakua placed the creature on Takanuva's mask. A moment later, the world around the Toa of Light fell away. Suddenly, he was seeing events from a time long past, when the universe was new. He heard the voice of Helryx, as if from far away.</p>
			<p>	"Watch and listen, Toa of Light," she said. "You have much to learn-and time is not your friend."</p>
			<h2>One</h2>
			<p>	Tahu Nuva rocketed down toward the Karda Nui swamp. Usually, he would have been planning strategy during the journey, trying to guess what threats might be waiting and how to deal with them. Today, though, just one thought dominated his mind:</p>
			<p>	<i>It's really a long way down.</i></p>
			<p>	He flashed back to just how he and his teammates had gotten here. Over 1,000 years ago, the evil Brotherhood of Makuta had attacked the Great Spirit Mata Nui, plunging that powerful entity into an unending sleep. His absence gave the Makuta an opportunity to seize power in various lands and spread their darkness throughout the universe.</p>
			<p>	The mission of the Toa Nuva was to rescue Mata Nui from his coma and restore order to the universe. So far, it hadn't been an easy one. The Brotherhood had thrown monsters and menaces against them, battling every step of the way. Now the quest had led to Karda Nui, the very core of the universe, the site of what would be the final battle.</p>
			<p>	The team had arrived only to discover the Brotherhood was already here. The Makuta had been mounting attacks on the Matoran of Light who lived in this place and were close to succeeding at conquering the region. After a few hard-fought battles, the Toa Nuva realized they had to split up. Half the team stayed above to fight the Makuta, while Tahu, Gali Nuva, and Onua Nuva headed for the swamp.</p>
			<p>	Now that he thought about it, it wasn't a plan that Tahu was too thrilled about. It went against his nature to run from a fight. But there was good reason to believe that the powerful Mask of Life was at the bottom of the swamp. If the Makuta found it first, they could wipe out every living thing in the blink of an eye.</p>
			<p>	<i>So here we are, flying through mist so thick even I couldn't burn it away, heading for a mud pool,</i> he said to himself. <i>Even that wouldn't be so bad, if this place didn't feel so...wrong.</i></p>
			<p>	Some time ago, on another island far away, Tahu had visited a site the Matoran called the "place of shadow". It had felt corrupt and unnatural, as if the fabric of the universe was just slightly off. Although he never admitted it at the time, he had found the spot highly disturbing. He had hoped never to experience such a place again, but as he approached the swamp, he knew he had not gotten his wish.</p>
			<p>	It was hard to see much of anything about the marsh at first, so shrouded was it in mist and fog. As the three Toa Nuva flew closer, they could see clumps of land of varying sizes dotting the murky water, most of them consisting of mud and moss. Thick foliage grew from the bottom of the swamp, but most of the plant life seemed strangely twisted and warped.</p>
			<p>	The most prominent features were the stalactites which had impaled themselves in the floor of the swamp during what the Matoran called "the Fall". Normally, these sorts of formations would grow from the top of a cavern down, narrowing to sharp points. But having broken off the cave ceiling long before, it was their fragile tips that now served as foundations and their wider ends that were home to Matoran villages far above. Onua Nuva frowned at the sight. He knew enough about stalactites to realize how easily these could collapse under their own weight, sending the villages plummeting into the swamp.</p>
			<p>	Gali Nuva was paying no attention to that. As Toa of Water, her concern was the mix of liquid protodermis and seawater that made up the swamp. The first thing she noticed was that it was hot, even boiling in some places. Even more surprising was that, despite the heat, it supported life. More than once, she spotted fins or tentacles breaking the slimy surface. She had seen many a creature of the sea in her time, and fought her share, but she was not at all sure she wanted to run into anything that thrived in such a place.</p>
			<p>	"This place has all the charm of a Makuta lair," she said.</p>
			<p>	Onua hovered in the air, eyeing the swamp with distaste. "So," he said finally. "Who's up for a swim?"</p>
			<p>	Gali landed on a patch of mud. Her armored feet immediately sank partway into the mire. "I can't say I look forward to it, but..."</p>
			<p>	"If the Mask of Life is below the surface, what choice do we have?" asked Tahu. "The Makuta would go down there to search for it."</p>
			<p>	"But would they ever come back up?" asked Onua.</p>
			<p>	"It may not even be down there," said Gali. "All we know is that it fell here. It could have landed among the vegetation, or sunk in the mud on one of these little islets." She looked around the vast swamp, which stretched for miles in every direction. "It could be...anywhere."</p>
			<p>	"We'll split up and search from the air," Tahu decided. "Pick a direction. If you spot anything, use your elemental power to alert the rest of us. If anything spots you...be careful. It's too much to hope the Makuta aren't already here."</p>
			<p class="center">&sect;	&sect;	&sect;</p>
			<p>Onua Nuva flew slowly, every sense alert. He had a reputation for being among the wisest of Toa, and his brains told him Tahu was right. The Makuta were somewhere in the swamp, they had to be. They were out to conquer Karda Nui, and the Brotherhood never did things by half-measures. Before they attacked the villages high above, they would want to make sure that the Matoran had no avenue of escape.</p>
			<p>	Sometimes, having so much knowledge was a curse. Onua knew all too well the history of the Brotherhood and Toa battles with them, thanks to studies he had made on Metru Nui. There had been a few legitimate victories by Toa over individual Makuta, but nothing truly final-the Makuta always managed to vanish into the shadows they loved. Other battles were less clear-cut. He had long suspected that his team's wins over Makuta had somehow been fixed, with the intent of throwing the heroes off the trail of something much bigger.</p>
			<p>	<i>Perhaps that is what bothers me most,</i> he thought, <i>the sense that something is not right in all this. The Brotherhood came close to killing the Great Spirit Mata Nui-but why? His death would have meant theirs, too, along with everything else in this universe. Now they concentrate their forces in Karda Nui, yet seem more interested in attacking Matoran villages than anything else.</i></p>
			<p>	On the face of it, it made no sense. If Karda Nui truly was the most important site to someday awakening Mata Nui-and if the Brotherhood wanted to stop that from happening-why not just destroy the place? They had the power. Why leave it intact for the Toa Nuva to find?</p>
			<p>	<i>Unless...they wanted us to find it. Unless they want Mata Nui awakened, even though they know his punishment for what they did would be terrible indeed. Or do they have reason to believe they will escape having to pay for their crimes?</i></p>
			<p>	That thought, more than any other, disturbed Onua. As a being tied to the element of earth, he knew how the slightest shift of the soil in one place could lead to a landslide somewhere else. He had learned early on how to manipulate the earth to suit his own purposes. The Makuta had no interest in doing such a thing with earth or water, fire or ice, but they were masters at manipulating others. And if they were somehow pulling the strings now...if the Toa Nuva were doing exactly what the Brotherhood wanted done, without realizing it...</p>
			<p>	<i>Then we may not be saving this universe,</i> he realized. <i>We may be dooming it forever.</i></p>
			<p>	He stopped to rest for a moment on a spit of mud in the center of the swamp. He had seen no trace of the Mask of Life or any Makuta. He had spotted a number of Rahi that would have sent even a Metru Nui archivist running to hide under the bed. The bizarre appearance of the wildlife was puzzling. Why would so many odd specimens be found in the same place?</p>
			<p>	A loud buzzing made him turn. A Nui-Kopen was darting toward him, on the attack. Onua had seen the large Rahi hornets before on the island of Mata Nui, but never one quite this size. He triggered the power of his Mask of Strength and swatted at the insect with an armored hand. The blow sent the Nui-Kopen spiraling through the air and into the swamp waters.</p>
			<p>	Expecting the creature to emerge again right away, Onua braced for another onslaught. Instead, he saw the insect flailing away in the muddy water, wings beating furiously. Then, to the Toa Nuva's shock, the Nui-Kopen started to transform. Tentacles sprouted from its sides, its wingspan expanded, and its tail transformed into a wickedly sharp, barbed stinger. When it flew again, it was as a vastly different creature than it had been just moments before.</p>
			<p>	<i>It's something in the water,</i> Onua realized, even as he uprooted a tree to use as a weapon. <i>Some kind of a mutagen that affected the Nui-Kopen-which means the others have to be warned! If any of us end up in the swamp, anything might happen.</i></p>
			<p>	The new Nui-Kopen hovered in the air, waiting for the right moment to attack. Onua Nuva drew back the tree, ready to swing it when the enemy got close enough. Then something struck the Toa of Earth in the back-just a glancing, painless blow. The next moment, he had dropped the tree and was standing, arms at his sides, rigid.</p>
			<p>	Onua frantically tried to move. He could feel his organic muscles flexing, but his mechanical parts refused to budge. He was paralyzed.</p>
			<p>	Someone or something landed in the mud behind him, but Onua couldn't make his head turn to look. A seemingly endless minute went by before the visitor moved into the Toa's line of sight. It was a yellow-armored being with a hideous face and spikes running the length of his legs. He carried a longsword and a launcher of a kind Onua was not familiar with. He looked Onua up and down with narrow, evil eyes and laughed softly.</p>
			<p>	"I always wanted my own Toa," said the newcomer. "Makuta Bitil's personal 'hero'. Kneel, Toa."</p>
			<p>	Against his will, Onua Nuva dropped to his knees. He wanted to ask how this Makuta was controlling his body, but couldn't get his mouth to move.</p>
			<p>	"It's this," Bitil answered, as if sensing Onua's question. He gestured to the launcher he carried. "A little invention of the Nynrah crafters of Xia. One shot and I control every mechanical part of your body. I could leave you here, on your knees, until you starve...or make you wade into the swamp and drown...or even have you kill your friends."</p>
			<p>	Bitil smiled. "But first I want the others to see what I have done. We will go see Krika. All of us."</p>
			<p>	As he said that, the mask the Makuta wore briefly flared to life. In the next instant, half a dozen more Bitils appeared, each as undeniably real as the first. Onua found himself forced to rise and jet into the air, surrounded by the duplicate Bitils.</p>
			<p>	"That's it," said the Makuta. "You know, I always wanted a pet..."</p>
			<p class="center">&sect;	&sect;	&sect;</p>
			<p>Gali Nuva skimmed low over the water, scanning for any sign of the Mask of Life. It had already been three hours with no trace, and she was beginning to despair of ever finding it. She also found it hard to concentrate on the search when she knew what might be happening to her friends who had remained behind with the Matoran.</p>
			<p>	It amazed her how a place could look so familiar and so strange at the same time. When they had first arrived in Karda Nui, all the Toa Nuva had suddenly realized they had been here before. It had been ages and ages ago, when they were still so inexperienced. But it hadn't looked like this, far from it. Then again, that had been so long ago.</p>
			<p>	Not for the first time, she wondered just how many millennia she and her teammates had spent locked in canisters, waiting for the day they might be needed. They had been clear from the start about the importance of their mission. It was their job to someday awaken Mata Nui should the Great Spirit ever succumb to injury or attack. What none of them had realized at the start was that, because their role was so vital, it would be decided they had to be shut away until it came time to play their part.</p>
			<p>	<i>Would we have agreed, had we known? Maybe. We were still so innocent then,</i> she thought. <i>But I wonder how much good we might have done in all those years if we had been free to act?</i></p>
			<p>	Gali flew on, wrapped up in her still-fragmented memories. Perhaps if she had been more alert, she might have heard something rising out of the swamp as she passed overhead. Then again, in close to 100,000 years, no one had ever spotted Makuta Gorast until it was much too late.</p>
			<p>&#xA;Tahu Nuva was the first of the team to spot something unusual, although it wasn't the Mask of Life. He wasn't quite sure what it was, though something in the back of his mind told him he should recognize it.</p>
			<p>	It was a solid sphere with no visible opening, embedded into the stone of one of the fallen stalactites. The structure stood out because it was obviously artificial-made of metal, not rock-and designed by intelligent beings. Tahu doubted it was a Matoran construction, since they spent as little time as possible in the swamp.</p>
			<p>	<i>If it belongs to the Makuta, it's a threat,</i> he thought. <i>And if it was created by someone else, it may hold answers. Either way, it's worth checking out.</i></p>
			<p>	Tahu flew toward the sphere, wary of a possible ambush, but still eager to investigate. This was the sort of thing he had hoped for in his first moments as a Toa: exploring the unknown, solving mysteries, and doing it all in the service of justice. His methods might not always have sat well with his teammates, but no one could question his dedication.</p>
			<p>	He circled the structure, giving it a wide berth. There were no signs of any hostile beings near it, not even any Rahi beasts. There was no visible weaponry either. But Tahu hadn't survived this long by being stupid. He activated his Mask of Shielding, throwing an energy field around himself, then moved in to investigate.</p>
			<p>	An instant later-impact! Tahu collided with a barrier he could not see. There was a flash of pure power, and the next thing he knew, he was being flung back across the swamp. Stunned, he just barely managed to keep his shield up. It was all that saved him as he crashed into a grove of trees with what would otherwise have been armor-shattering impact.</p>
			<p>	Tahu tumbled down into the mud and lay there, unconscious. All was still and silent. Swamp birds glanced down from the branches at this strange sight, while insects buzzed around his prone body. Suddenly, the Rahi scattered as the temperature abruptly dropped. A moment later, a pale, white form drifted up through the mud like a ghost. The being hovered for a moment, then turned solid, coming to rest on four long legs lined with jagged claws. Bending low over Tahu, the newcomer prepared to feed.</p>
			<h2>Interlude One</h2>
			<p><b>Takanuva's vision of the past...</b></p>
			<p>&#xA;	The crimson-armored being opened his eyes and looked around. He did not recognize where he was, nor did he have any idea who the five figures nearby might be. Each of them was lying on a slab, just like him, and each wore colored armor and a mask. But where he was red, they were other hues: white, blue, green, black, and brown.</p>
			<p>	Of course, it came as no great surprise that he didn't know who these others were. After all, he wasn't sure who he was, either.</p>
			<p>	he started to rise, then found he could not. Thick metal straps encircled him, keeping him pinned to the slab. Unsure of his identity as he was, he still knew that he did not like being bound. He tried to exert his strength against the bonds, but without success. His frustration and anger grew. And then, suddenly, the metal of the straps was growing soft, turning to molten liquid, running off him and onto the floor.</p>
			<p>	<i>Did I do that?</i> he wondered, as he sat up.</p>
			<p>	On the next slab, the white-armored figure had frozen his straps, and then shattered them with the merest gesture. The others had all found unique ways to escape their bonds as well.</p>
			<p>	"Well, we're all free," said the red-armored being. "Now what? Anyone know where we are...or who we are?"</p>
			<p>	The answer came then, but not from any of them. Rather, it was a voice that seemed to come from every part of the room that spoke in reply. "You are Toa."</p>
			<p>	The figure in brown armor jumped down from his slab and onto his feet. "Toa! Hey, that's great. I always wanted to be a Toa." He looked up and addressed his next words to the ceiling. "Just one question: what's a Toa?"</p>
			<p>	"A Toa is a hero," the voice answered. "Every Toa commands an elemental power, which can be focused through your weapons. Each of you also wears a Great Mask, with a power all its own. You will learn about these powers in time, as well as how to control them."</p>
			<p>	The white-armored figure frowned. "To whom are we meant to be heroes, and why? You say we have great abilities, but what are we meant to do with them? Too many questions for my taste."</p>
			<p>	The unseen speaker laughed softly. "You underestimate yourself, Kopaka-yes, that is your name. Questions will always whet your appetite for answers. But now it is time for you to meet."</p>
			<p>	A lightstone illuminated on the ceiling above Kopaka, as the voice said, "Kopaka, Toa of Ice."</p>
			<p>	One by one, the lightstones lit above the others as the speaker recited their names.</p>
			<p>	"Gali, Toa of Water."</p>
			<p>	"Pohatu, Toa of Stone."</p>
			<p>	"Onua, Toa of Earth."</p>
			<p>	"Lewa, Toa of Air."</p>
			<p>	The last to be named was the crimson-armored figure. "And Tahu, Toa of Fire. He will be your leader."</p>
			<p>	That seemed to startle Kopaka, who said sharply, "It seems to me we should be allowed to choose our own leader."</p>
			<p>	"I have to agree," said Gali quietly. "I mean, none of us know anything about this Tahu. What if he's too impulsive to be a good leader? What if he lacks the ability to work with his team members, or can't motivate, or-"</p>
			<p>	Lewa chuckled. "Or what if he's just a jerk?"</p>
			<p>	A bolt of flame shot from an irritated Tahu past the Toa of Air, close enough to heat his mask to an uncomfortable temperature. Lewa reached up and yanked the mask off. Immediately, he felt so weak he almost fell over. Pohatu and Onua rushed to support him.</p>
			<p>	"You must not remove your masks, unless you are replacing one with another," the voice said. "Without them, your strength is halved."</p>
			<p>	Lewa gingerly returned the hot mask to his face. "Thanks-<i>ow!</i>-for telling us." He turned to glare at Tahu. "And as for you, fireflyer, better be careful a big wind doesn't blow you out one of these days."</p>
			<p>	"Big wind," Tahu said, nodding. "Yes, that's you, all right."</p>
			<p>	Kopaka decided to ignore the argument. "So we are a team," he said to their unseen host. "Again, I ask-for what purpose? What are we meant to do?"</p>
			<p>	A panel slid open in the far wall. Beyond, there was only darkness.</p>
			<p>	"The gateway to another mystery, perhaps," said Onua. "I wonder if a Toa's life is filled with them."</p>
			<p>	"Then this will be just the first of many we walk through," Tahu replied. "Let's go."</p>
			<p>&#xA;Beyond the door, there was a long, narrow platform that jutted out into the empty space of a massive, spherical chamber. The cavernous room was totally dark. Only Onua was able to see at all, thanks to excellent night vision the others lacked.</p>
			<p>	This was not altogether a blessing, because it allowed him to see just how high off the ground they were standing. He peered nervously over the edge of the platform. Being a creature of the earth, heights were not his favorite thing.</p>
			<p>	There was a sudden burst of light. A symbol illuminated in mid-air and hung silently before the eyes of the Toa. In the center was an oval shape, flanked to the northeast and southwest by two much smaller ones. On either side of the three ovals were larger curved shapes which ended in two sharp points.</p>
			<p>	The voice spoke again. "Your universe is guided and protected by the Great Spirit Mata Nui. You, in turn, shall be Mata Nui's protectors. What you see before you is the symbol of his might and purpose."</p>
			<p>	Pohatu was the first to put what all the Toa were thinking into words. "If he's a 'Great Spirit', why does he need protection?"</p>
			<p>	The universe is vast and holds many dangers," the voice replied. "If Mata Nui should ever be struck down, it will be your role-your destiny-to restore him to power. If that time comes, you will know what to do."</p>
			<p>	"And in the meantime?" asked Tahu. "Do we just sit around and wait?"</p>
			<p>	"You will train. You will learn," the voice said. "And, in time, you will go to the aid of the Matoran, who labor to carry out the will of Mata Nui."</p>
			<p>	"Sure," said Pohatu. "Hey, the Matoran could probably use our help. You know, what with laboring all day to carry out somebody's will and everything."</p>
			<p>	All five other Toa turned to look at Pohatu. Finally, Gali smiled and said, "All right, Pohatu. Go ahead. Say it."</p>
			<p>	Pohatu shrugged, looked up, and asked, "Okay, I give up: what's a Matoran?"</p>
			<h2>Two</h2>
			<p>	It took only minutes for Bitil, his doubles, and Onua Nuva to reach Krika's lair deep in the swamp. There was no sign of any living being, only dead Rahi scattered about in the mud. That didn't seem to deter Bitil, who landed on the small islet and stood, waiting.</p>
			<p>	"Krika? Show yourself."</p>
			<p>	Onua Nuva wanted to look around to see if anyone was coming...and suddenly realized that he could. Whatever Bitil had hit him with had worn off. But he stayed perfectly still, not wanting to let the Makuta know his body was his own again.</p>
			<p>	"You never see him until the last moment," Bitil muttered. "I hate that."</p>
			<p>	The other Bitils nodded in agreement, all but one, who looked very confused. Now that Onua took a second look, he realized that particular version of Bitil was not an exact duplicate of the others. In fact, he was quite different in appearance, lacking the leg blades and the hideous face of his companions.</p>
			<p>	The Toa of Earth had no idea what was going on here. But whatever it was, it had started with the Makuta that had captured him. He waited until that one's back was turned, then charged forward and caught him in a headlock. He swung Bitil around as the others surged forward.</p>
			<p>	"I wouldn't," said Onua. "Not if you like his head attached to his body."</p>
			<p>	Six pairs of arms were outstretched toward Onua. Shadow energy began to gather in the palms of twelve hands as Bitil's duplicates prepared to attack.</p>
			<p>	"What happens to you doubles if the original dies?" Onua continued. "Do you really want to find out?"</p>
			<p>	The Bitil Onua held prisoner began to laugh. Then, with a mere shrug, he broke the Toa's grip and sent Onua sprawling on the ground in front of the duplicates. "You fool," said Makuta Bitil. "These aren't just doubles-they <i>are</i> me. They are <i>all</i> me. Each one plucked from my past to aid me in the present. Instant army, ever loyal, and I can call on as many as I need. See?"</p>
			<p>	As Onua rose, he saw that six Bitils had become a dozen, then two dozen, then close to 50. Some were standing, some flying, some resembled Bitil exactly and some hardly at all. But they all hated the sight of a Toa.</p>
			<p>	"Unfortunately, they-<i>we</i>-never seem to remember what we see in our own future," Bitil continued. "Shame they won't recall the moment of your death."</p>
			<p>	Onua had made it to his knees. "Then I guess we better make it...memorable," said the Toa of Earth.</p>
			<p>	Closing his eyes, he called upon his elemental power. Ruled by his will, the substance of the islet exploded, sending tons of mud into the air. Along with it flew Onua, rocketing up and away from Makuta Bitil and his legion.</p>
			<p>	When he felt he was high enough, he turned to see one mud-spattered enemy flying up after him. Shattered concentration had shut off Bitil's mask power, sending his duplicates back to the past. Onua readied his Midak Skyblaster-and then discovered to his surprise that his weapon was no longer a skyblaster. It had morphed into something resembling Bitil's launcher. <i>Here goes nothing, then,</i> thought Onua as he fired.</p>
			<p>	The rocket hit his foe head on, but the effect was completely unexpected. A sphere of pure energy formed around the Makuta, cutting him off from Onua. The next instant, the sphere dropped like a stone, carrying Bitil all the way back down into the swamp.</p>
			<p>	Onua banked to the right and flew off. He had to warn the others that the Makuta were here in force...if it wasn't already too late. But how to find Gali and Tahu?</p>
			<p>	Half that problem was suddenly solved. A huge fireball rocketed into the air far to the east. That was a call for help if ever Onua saw one. Angling his wings and triggering the rockets on his armor, he headed for battle.</p>
			<p class="center">&sect;	&sect;	&sect;</p>
			<p>Gali Nuva couldn't believe her luck. No, she hadn't spotted the Mask of Life, but she had seen what appeared to be a keystone. The Toa Nuva had discovered some fragments of an ancient tablet in the Matoran villages up above. Inscribed on them were directions for how to awaken the Great Spirit Mata Nui. But the fragments were of no use unless all six of them could be collected and read together.</p>
			<p>	This particular stone fragment was wrapped up in the vines of a huge swamp plant. She was tempted to jet in and grab it quickly, but memory intruded. She recalled tales the Turaga told of an evil, intelligent plant called Morbuzakh that once tried to crush the city of Metru Nui. There was no telling what the plant life was like down in this strange place. Better to approach with caution.</p>
			<p>&#xA;Makuta Gorast could not believe her luck. Stuck in this miserable swamp, mutated by the waters, and no longer able to shapeshift, she had begun to question her role in the Brotherhood's plan. Surely she was meant for something better than wading through mud, feeding off the small reserves of light in Rahi? Perhaps Makuta Icarax had been right all along...this grand Plan involved too much waiting and not enough killing.</p>
			<p>	She swiftly rejected that notion. The Plan was what mattered, nothing else, and certainly not the needs of any individual Makuta.</p>
			<p>	But now, Fate had sent her a Toa, no doubt brimming with light. She was tempted to glide in silently on her wing blades and attack, leaving this Toa of Water a corrupted husk in the end. But she had heard tales from other Makuta about how Toa were sometimes the most dangerous when they seemed most vulnerable. Better, she decided, to approach with caution.</p>
			<p>&#xA;A mini-tidal wave of swamp water smashed into the plant, shaking its thick trunk. When the wave subsided, the keystone was still firmly lodged in its tendrils. Gali summoned another fist of water, targeting it right at the spot where the stone was trapped. This time, the fragment actually moved slightly, starting to work its way loose of the plant's grip. Another three attempts, and the stone fell to the soft earth.</p>
			<p>	Gali went to retrieve it. It wouldn't be long now.</p>
			<p>&#xA;Gorast watched as the Toa of Water harnessed her elemental power to dislodge a piece of rock from a plant. She vaguely recalled Antroz telling her that if she saw such a stone, she should gather it up and deliver it to him. But her hunger for light had driven that order from her mind until now.</p>
			<p>	<i>Better and better,</i> she thought. <i>I will drain a Toa and carry out my orders at the same time.</i></p>
			<p>	The keystone was finally loose, and the Toa was headed for it. Gorast dove to attack. It wouldn't be long now.</p>
			<p>&#xA;Gali's fist closed on the stone even as she remembered something else. It was a hazy recollection of something said to her long, long ago. She had been in a barren, unbearably hot place, she recalled. There had been a battle, and she had lost, though not to an enemy. Someone was standing over her.</p>
			<p>	"The danger isn't always what you see," he was saying. "Often, it's what you don't see until it's too late."</p>
			<p>	The thought made her turn. Gorast was bearing down on her. Gali didn't bother to think, just reacted, sending a pile driver fist of water slamming into the Makuta.</p>
			<p>	Gorast spun crazily through the air, finally latching onto a tree with her four clawed hands. Hissing angrily, she rocketed toward Gali. The Toa hurled another water blast. Gorast dodged and plowed headfirst into Gali's midsection. Gali smashed into a tree, tearing it out of the ground and sending it toppling into the swamp.</p>
			<p>	Gorast landed in the mud and raced toward the fallen Toa. Dazed, Gali still managed to throw a water sphere around Gorast's head, cutting off the Makuta's air. Gorast tried to shake it off, but the sphere held fast.</p>
			<p>	Gali glanced at her weapon, finding it had morphed into a virtual duplicate of what Gorast carried. She banished the water sphere even as she fired, sending chains of energy coiling around Gorast like snakes.</p>
			<p>	"Surrender. Or would you rather go for another swim on dry land, Makuta?" Gali said. "That is what you are, isn't it? Another Makuta?"</p>
			<p>	"Gorast," said her captive. "Makuta of the Tren Krom peninsula, mistress of the acid falls, conqueror of the Visorak horde-and you are Gali Nuva, Toa of Raindrops."</p>
			<p>	With a seemingly effortless shrug, Gorast snapped the chains that bound her. "And Makuta do not surrender...for the same reasons Toa do not kill."</p>
			<p>	Gorast fired her Nynrah blaster. Gali dove, narrowly avoiding the shot, and fired quick bursts of water even as she slid through the mud. Gorast batted away the projectiles with her four arms and advanced. Thinking quickly, Gali increased the moisture in the mud beneath Gorast's feet. The Makuta began to sink into the ground, weighed down by her armor. She tried to fly out, but the mud clung to her as if it were alive and hungry.</p>
			<p>	"You Makuta think we're weak because we don't kill our enemies," Gali said, rising and walking to where Gorast struggled to be free. "But sometimes, killing can be a mercy. Sometimes the worst thing you can do to an enemy is let her live."</p>
			<p>	Gorast nodded. "And sometimes the worst is to deprive your enemy of that satisfaction." With that said, Gorast shut her eyes and plunged beneath the mud pool. Gali started forward, stunned that the Makuta was committing suicide rather than surrendering. There was no sign of Gorast, not even an air bubble breaching the surface.</p>
			<p>	"Stupid," muttered Gali. "Didn't life mean anything to her, even her own?"</p>
			<p>	There was an explosion of mud behind her. Gorast tore out of the ground like an avenging spirit and drove her stinger into Gali's back. "My life doesn't matter," said the Makuta. "Your life doesn't matter. Only the Plan matters."</p>
			<p>	A huge fireball flew into the sky then, illuminating the horrible sight of a Toa's light being drained away...if there was anyone around to see.</p>
			<p>&#xA;Tahu Nuva hated the cold. Perhaps that was why there was always bad blood between him and Kopaka, Toa of Ice. Fire brought warmth and light; it was used to forge masks and tools; it was essential to life itself. Ice brought nothing but death.</p>
			<p>	Now, as he lay in the mud, he felt a cold that reached into his very muscles and threatened to freeze them solid. He had never felt anything quite like it, not even in mock battle with Kopaka. It didn't feel like physical cold-it was more a chill of the spirit.</p>
			<p>	Tahu opened his eyes. The first thing he saw was a long, white, vaguely insectoid leg lined with sharp, curved spikes. It shifted slightly in the mud, revealing three more just like it. Whoever they belonged to was bending over Tahu, but the Toa of Fire doubted it would wake him up gently.</p>
			<p>	Despite the cold, Tahu forced himself to roll away. Once he had put a little distance between him and his visitor, he got the chance to get a good look-and promptly wished he had not. The creature facing him had a long, narrow, white head with bony ridges extending from its brow partway down its spine. Its forelegs were very long, its hind legs shorter, and one arm held a weapon. It looked like some kind of monstrous Rahi and gazed at Tahu with crimson, hate-filled eyes.</p>
			<p>	"Once, I was like you," the bizarre being said.</p>
			<p>	"Like me? You mean you were a Toa?" asked Tahu. He was on his feet now, weapon at the ready.</p>
			<p>	The creature laughed. It sounded like a skeleton being crushed underfoot. "No. Once I was alive like you: solid and whole, needing no one and nothing. I was Makuta Krika, my name whispered in legends throughout half the known universe. And now..."</p>
			<p>	"What changed?" asked Tahu. He had noted how softly this being was speaking, an old trick to draw a potential victim in closer. The Toa had no intention of falling for it.</p>
			<p>	"Everything changed, Tahu...oh, yes, I know who you are," said Krika. "It changed the day Makuta Teridax unveiled his plan to conquer the Great Spirit and we fell into step behind him-some out of fear, some out of greed, some for...other reasons."</p>
			<p>	Krika shrugged, the wickedly sharp ends of his forelegs rising out of the mud for just a moment before sinking back in. "Our great Plan. It has cost the Brotherhood of Makuta much time and treasure. It has cost me far more."</p>
			<p>	"Why are you telling me all this?" Tahu asked.</p>
			<p>	"Do you know why the Brotherhood of Makuta hates Toa so much?"</p>
			<p>	"I could think of lots of reasons," Tahu replied.</p>
			<p>	"It's because you are what we could only pretend to be, once upon a time: heroes who do good for no reward. You are given freely the honor and acclaim that could never come fast enough for us. And so we call you fools, and worse, and slay you...because we cannot be you."</p>
			<p>	"Am I supposed to feel sorry for you?" snapped Tahu. "After all the evil you and your kind have done? I don't think so. Share your burdens with someone who cares."</p>
			<p>	Krika shrugged again. "I simply thought that you would want to know..."</p>
			<p>	The temperature suddenly dropped sharply. This time, Tahu felt as if the energy was being drained from his body. Too weak to stand, he fell into the mud.</p>
			<p>	"...Why it is you have to die," finished the Makuta.</p>
			<p>	The world was starting to spin around Tahu. He was going to have time for one action, and if it didn't work, he would be a dead Toa. With enormous effort, he raised one arm and hurled a huge fireball straight and high into the air. He could only hope Gali or Onua would see it in time.</p>
			<p>	Krika glanced up, his eyes following the flight of the fiery object. He smiled, but it was a sad smile, for he knew Toa all too well. Tahu's flare would bring more running to their deaths. They were doomed.</p>
			<p>	<i>And perhaps,</i> thought Krika, <i>that is the one thing I have in common with my foes.</i></p>
			<h2>Interlude Two</h2>
			<p><b>Takanuva's vision of the past continues...</b></p>
			<p>&#xA;	Gali hit the ground hard, and not for the first time. By now, her muscles ached, her armor was cracked in a few places, and her Mask of Power had already been knocked off half a dozen times. She was tired, she was irritated, and she still couldn't see the point of any of this.</p>
			<p>	"I'm a Toa of Water," she grumbled as she got to her feet. "So what am I doing here?"</p>
			<p>	Her trainer, Hydraxon, shook his head. "You're a Toa of Water. That's true. So naturally your foes will be sure to attack you only when there's plenty of water around...that's <i>false</i>."</p>
			<p>	Faster than her eye could follow, he whipped a boomerang at her. It swooped low and struck her in the legs, knocking her off her feet again.</p>
			<p>	Hydraxon gestured at the landscape around them. It was barren desert for as far as the eye could see. The humidity in the air was close to zero. "If you want water, you're going to have to make it yourself," he said. "Provided I don't carve you up before you get the chance."</p>
			<p>	Gali sprang up this time and charged Hydraxon, swinging the hooked tools she carried. He caught one on his armored wrist, grabbed her arm with his free hand, and tossed her over his hip. She landed flat on her back.</p>
			<p>	"I could do this all day," Hydraxon said, smiling. "And if you keep thinking with your heart, not your head, I'll probably have to."</p>
			<p>	Gali scrambled to her feet, but this time she didn't attack. Instead, she took a few steps backward, keeping her eyes trained on Hydraxon's hands. If he was going to toss another blade or boomerang, this time she would be ready.</p>
			<p>	As it turned out, his hands never moved. Instead, he lashed out with a kick at a nearby dune, spraying a load of sand into her face. While she was blinded, he threw two knives, knocking both hooks from her hands.</p>
			<p>	"Now you're disarmed, <i>and</i> you can't see," he said. "That means you have about half a second to live, and that's if your enemy's slow."</p>
			<p>	<i>Just keep talking,</i> Gali thought. <i>We'll see who has how much time left.</i></p>
			<p>	Concentrating hard, she fired a jet of water from the palm of her hand. It hit Hydraxon with the force of a small explosion, knocking him to the ground. When her vision cleared, she saw him reaching for one of his weapons. She fired again, pinning him to the ground with her water blast.</p>
			<p>	"Give up?" she asked.</p>
			<p>	"Not even a little," Hydraxon replied.</p>
			<p>	Gali heard movement behind her too late. A silver energy hound slammed into her from behind, putting her face-first in the sand. With her concentration shattered, her water blast was cut off. Hydraxon got up, grabbed her by the back of the neck, and hauled her to her feet.</p>
			<p>	"Meet Spinax," he said, gesturing to the four-legged beast who still eyed her warily. "After I'm done training you would-be heroes, I have a new assignment, and he's coming along. For now, though, he helps me prove a point-the danger isn't always what you see. Often, it's what you don't see until it's too late."</p>
			<p>	Gali spat out sand. Somehow, she managed a smile. "I don't envy the group working with you in your next job."</p>
			<p>	To her surprise, Hydraxon's face darkened. "You shouldn't. Trust me, you shouldn't envy them at all."</p>
			<p>	Suddenly uncomfortable, Gali tried to change the subject. "So, lesson learned. Are we done for today?"</p>
			<p>	Hydraxon, who had been lost in thought, suddenly seemed to remember she was there. "Hmmm? No, no. You have a 15-minute head start. Then I send Spinax after you. They say he can track a wisp of energy across a planet and back...so I suggest you start running."</p>
			<p>	"And what am I supposed to learn from that?" demanded Gali.</p>
			<p>	"It's not training for you," replied Hydraxon, smiling. "It's training for him."</p>
			<p>&#xA;By the time Gali made it back to the Toa's shelter, she was exhausted and sore. "Mask of Water Breathing," she sighed. "Big help when there's no water anywhere around."</p>
			<p>	Pohatu laughed. "I thought I'd be able to outrun the little beast with my mask, but darn thing never gives up. Ran so fast I fused some of the sand to glass, and Spinax still caught me the second I slowed down. Kopaka's the only one who passed that test."</p>
			<p>	Gali turned to the Toa of Ice. "What did you do?"</p>
			<p>	Kopaka shrugged. "I froze him."</p>
			<p>	"You didn't!"</p>
			<p>	"He did," said Lewa. The Toa of Air was floating halfway off the floor. Determined to master his Mask of Levitation, his feet were almost never on the ground anymore.</p>
			<p>	"So what happened?" asked Gali.</p>
			<p>	"Nothing," muttered Kopaka.</p>
			<p>	"Nothing?" Onua chuckled. "Hydraxon commended him on his original thinking."</p>
			<p>	"And then knocked him flat," Tahu added. "Was it six times or eight times in a row, brother?"</p>
			<p>	"I didn't see you do any better, Toa of Ashes," bristled Kopaka.</p>
			<p>	"I guess a Mask of Shielding doesn't help much when the boomerangs keep hitting you from behind, huh, Tahu?" said Lewa.</p>
			<p>	Onua glanced at Tahu and Kopaka and saw neither one was laughing. "Well, we all need to do better," said the Toa of Earth. "Someday, it won't be a trainer we'll be up against, but the real thing."</p>
			<p>	"That cannot be soon enough for me," said Kopaka. "Perhaps then there will be less talking."</p>
			<p>	Lewa drifted back down to the ground, landing beside Gali. "Friendly sort, isn't he?" he whispered.</p>
			<p>	"He's a loner, but one who's smart enough to know he can't succeed alone," Gali replied. "It makes him angry, but he tries to keep it all frozen inside."</p>
			<p>	"While Tahu keeps fanning the flames between them, like he's trying to prove something," said Lewa. "Maybe we better stick together, sister. Those two could get us killed."</p>
			<h2>Three</h2>
			<p>	In her time, Gorast had taken some pretty hard blows. Some brute named Krekka once tried to stop her from going where she wanted to and made his case with a solid shot that sent her through a wall. (He paid for that, in full, not too long after.) Then there was the time she had been on the wrong end of a Tahtorak charge.</p>
			<p>	But nothing before could equal Onua Nuva seizing her, lifting her high into the air, and slamming her down with every bit of force his own power and the Mask of Strength could afford him. Even for the raw might of a Makuta, the world spun.</p>
			<p>	"Stay down while I check on Gali," Onua said, his tone that of an earthquake about to erupt. "And if she's hurt, so help me, I will send you back where you came from in pieces."</p>
			<p>	Onua took a few steps back so he could keep an eye on Gorast while looking to his fallen friend. Gali was still breathing and didn't seem badly hurt, only dazed. Whatever this thing was-another Makuta or some form of Rahi beast-and whatever it had been doing when Onua arrived, it evidently had not gone too far.</p>
			<p>	Gorast hadn't moved, just lay in the mud eyeing Onua with...rage? No, the Toa realized, it was something else. Something far more disturbing: hunger.</p>
			<p>	Onua got Gali to her feet. Gorast scrambled to hers at the same time. "Be careful," whispered Gali. "She's dangerous."</p>
			<p>	"You are Onua, aren't you? The wise one?" hissed Gorast. "Brilliant and strong, yet never the leader-always forced to follow the orders of fools like Tahu. The Brotherhood would make you a king. You would have all of Metru Nui to rule, Toa...all you have to do is stand by my side."</p>
			<p>	"My armor's black," Onua replied. "That doesn't mean my heart is as well. The answer is no."</p>
			<p>	Gorast surged forward. Onua met her with a geyser of mud summoned from the ground. As she fought her way through that, he scooped Gali up in his arms and flew, heading toward where the fireball had been. He had to find Tahu so the three of them could stand together.</p>
			<p>	Gorast took off after him. She knew full well where he was going and wasn't worried at all. The light of three Toa would be a feast to long remember.</p>
			<p>&#xA;Tahu's mind raced even as his body's energy faded away. He had managed to figure out what was happening to him. Krika drained energy from his victims. If there was no one nearby, he took it from the environment. That explained the temperature drops that accompanied his appearances. Now Tahu just needed to figure out a way to stop him.</p>
			<p>	<i>Temperature...heat...cold...that's the key,</i> he thought. <i>Wherever he goes, the air turns cold...if that's what he's used to...maybe I should serve up a little baked Makuta.</i></p>
			<p>	Flame was beyond his abilities just then, but Tahu could still generate heat. He poured what remained of his energy into the ground, willing the soil and water to grow searingly hot until the mud was boiling. Krika gave out a cry of pain and then turned intangible. He drifted above the seething cauldron that a moment before had been just a mere spot of soft ground in a vast swamp.</p>
			<p>	Tahu didn't care that Krika had escaped. All that mattered to him was that the drain on his energy had stopped. Maybe it was the burns, maybe it was changing to his ghostly form, but Krika's mealtime was over.</p>
			<p>	The Toa of Fire glanced up and saw more good news. Onua and Gali were on their way. True, they had two vicious-looking creatures on their tails, but the sight of his two teammates was still the best thing he had ever seen.</p>
			<p>	Tahu absorbed the heat of the ground back into himself long enough for Onua and Gali to land. Krika floated above the three of them while Onua's pursuers circled like Nui-Rama wasps. Tahu forced himself to rise and used his mask power to throw a shield around the three Toa Nuva.</p>
			<p>	"I see you brought company," he said to Onua.</p>
			<p>	"It couldn't be helped. Gali has been weakened, and you don't look too well yourself."</p>
			<p>	"My shield will take a few blasts, and then..." Tahu replied. His eyes were suddenly drawn to something in the sky. "Wait, what's that?"</p>
			<p>	Onua turned to look and noted that all three Makuta were doing the same. What they had spotted was another Makuta, Chirox, plummeting from the sky. He obviously wasn't in control of his flight. Onua guessed he had been on the receiving end of a solid blow from one of the three Toa Nuva battling in the skies above.</p>
			<p>	Gorast, Bitil, and Krika reacted immediately, flying or floating to intercept their brother. It seemed the perfect time to make an escape, although with Tahu and Gali both low on energy, Onua wasn't sure how far they would get.</p>
			<p>	"This way," said a small voice off to the left. "Come this way, now."</p>
			<p>	Onua saw that the voice came from an Av-Matoran. The figure was beckoning to the Toa through some swamp foliage. "I can take you to safety," the Matoran said.</p>
			<p>	The Toa Nuva of Earth knew it might be a trap, but at this point, he had to take a chance. Tahu nodded his assent, and the three heroes followed the Matoran deeper into the swamp.</p>
			<p>	They ended up in a small clearing surrounded by lightvines, the plants the Matoran of Karda Nui used as protection against the Makuta. Natural light producers, the vines were painful for the masters of shadow to come near. But what struck the three Toa was what lay on the ground-the bodies of at least a dozen Matoran, all apparently in the midst of some strange transformation.</p>
			<p>	Onua started to rush toward the fallen villagers, but the Matoran who had guided them there blocked him. "Don't interfere. It's their time, just as it will soon be mine."</p>
			<p>	"Their time? For what?" said Gali, pushing past Onua and the Matoran. She rushed to the nearest villager. What she saw made her gasp and take a step back.</p>
			<p>	The Av-Matoran's body was changing before her eyes. Muscle tissue and lung tissue were dissolving, being replaced by metallic protodermis. The shape of the body was changing too, becoming bigger and broader, even as the normal features of a Matoran rapidly disappeared. But that wasn't what shocked Gali and the other Toa Nuva. No, it was that they recognized all too well what the Av-Matoran were transforming into.</p>
			<p>	"Bohrok," whispered the Toa of Water, shaken to her core. "By the Great Beings, they are turning into Bohrok!"</p>
			<p>&#xA;Krika was the first to notice that the Toa Nuva were gone. Bitil and Gorast wanted to immediately pursue, but Krika waved them off. "Where can they run to? You know as well as I that they cannot leave the swamp without this," he said, raising his foreleg to reveal a keystone embedded between his spikes. With a casual movement, he tossed the stone to Bitil.</p>
			<p>	"What if they don't find the other five?" asked Gorast.</p>
