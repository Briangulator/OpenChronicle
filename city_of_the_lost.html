			<h1>BIONICLE Legends #6: City of the Lost</h1>
			<h3>Greg Farshtey</h3>
			<h2>Prologue</h2>
			<p><b>80,000 Years Ago</b></p>
			<p>&#xA;	Pridak stood on the tower of his island fortress, looking down at his assembled army. His troops came from and endless number of places. Some were Matoran criminals, others violent brutes looking for the chance to fight, and by far the majority were simply beings who were no longer welcome in their homelands. They were thieves, murderers, traitors, and liars, and easily the most beautiful sight he had ever seen.</p>
			<p>	He shifted his gaze to the west. There, Takadox's and Mantax's armies had set up camp. To the east, legions of Kalmah and Ehlek were preparing for battle. Carapar's army was the last to arrive and they had immediately begun skirmishing with some of the others. No effort had been made to stop them. It was best they keep their weapons and their battle instincts sharp for what was to come.</p>
			<p>	Pridak took a deep breath. The air smelled sweet. He wanted to savor these last few moments of his old life. Soon, he would no longer be just the ruler of a small realm, one almost beneath the notice of the Great Spirit Mata Nui. Before this day was through, he would be the undisputed king of one-sixth of the known universe.</p>
			<p>	If it were possible for a biomechanical being to be a perfect physical specimen, Pridak was it. Even if his armor and weapons had been taken away, he would still have radiated power. It was hard for him to comprehend how some beings, even entire intelligent species, could live out their lives with monstrous appearances. He imagined they must just be dead inside and so didn't notice the horror they inspired.</p>
			<p>	A strong wind set the island's trees to swaying. The scent of campfires, unwashed Matoran, and Rahi mounts combined into a musty, foul aroma. The smell triggered memories of past conquests. They had been hard-fought battles, and well worth winning, but they could not compare with what he and his allies were about to undertake.</p>
			<p>	One of his battle leaders approached. "Sir, all is ready. We await your order to strike."</p>
			<p>	Pridak nodded, his keen eyes trained on his legions below. "Indeed. Three members of a Matoran rear guard unit have propped their weapons against rocks and are having a conversation among themselves. Why?"</p>
			<p>	The battle leader turned to look. Then, flustered, he answered, "I...have no explanation, sir. They will be disciplined at once."</p>
			<p>	A tight smile appeared on Pridak's face. "Three ignore their orders while their fifty companions stand at attention and do nothing about it. Not at all satisfactory."</p>
			<p>	He turned to the battle leader. "Pass the word among my legions. That unit is to be attacked and completely destroyed, immediately...along with you."</p>
			<p>	"What? Sir, I...I..."</p>
			<p>	Pridak's hand flashed out and grabbed the battle leader by the throat. He took two quick strides and thrust the unfortunate being over the edge of the tower. His captive's legs dangled in space.</p>
			<p>	"Am I speaking some unknown Matoran dialect?" Pridak whispered. "Do you require a translator? I want you to go down there and order your own destruction. I want you to do it now."</p>
			<p>	Pridak leaned in close, his fetid breath washing over his frightened subordinate. "Be assured my legions will be far swifter and more merciful in carrying out their task than I would be."</p>
			<p>	With that, Pridak idly tossed the battle leader back onto the stone floor of the tower. The panicked being scrambled to his feet and raced down the stairs to carry out his orders. When he reached the bottom, he would command the legions to immediately wipe out the offending unit and then himself. He would do this because he knew Pridak was right. Death at their hands would be far preferable to the same fate in the clutches of his ruler.</p>

			<p>The other five Barraki were waiting in the fortress's central chamber, studying maps carved into stone tablets. They had been given their name centuries ago by the subjects of their realms. It was an old Matoran word, rarely ever heard, which roughly translated to "warlord". Each was powerful, well armored, and veteran of many a raid. Those who saw them said they made Toa look like some kind of Rahi that crawled out from under a rock. They saw themselves as a higher level of being, preordained to rule by virtue of their superior strength and intellect.</p>
